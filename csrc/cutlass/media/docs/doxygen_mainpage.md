# CUTLASS 3.0

_CUTLASS 3.0 - January 2023_

CUTLASS is a collection of CUDA C++ template abstractions for implementing
high-performance matrix-multiplication (GEMM) at all levels and scales within CUDA.
It incorporates strategies for hierarchical decomposition and data movement similar
to those used to implement cuBLAS.  CUTLASS decomposes these "moving parts" into
reusable, modular software components abstracted by C++ template classes.  These
components can be specialized
and tuned via custom tiling sizes, data types, and other algorithmic policies. The
resulting flexibility simplifies their use as building blocks within custom kernels
and applications.

To support a wide variety of applications, CUTLASS provides extensive support for
mixed-precision computations, providing specialized data-movement and
multiply-accumulate abstractions for 8-bit integer, half-precision floating
point (FP16), single-precision floating point (FP32), and double-precision floating
point (FP64) types.  Furthermore, CUTLASS exploits the _Tensor Cores_ and asynchronous
memory copy operations of the latest NVIDIA GPU architectures.

# What's New in CUTLASS 3.0

For an overview of CUTLASS 3.0's GEMM interface levels,
please refer to the
[CUTLASS 3.0 GEMM API document](./gemm_api_3x.md).
To learn how to migrate code using CUTLASS 2.x's interface
to CUTLASS 3.0, please refer to the
[backwards compatibility document](./cutlass_3x_backwards_compatibility.md).

# GEMM examples

For a code example showing how to define
a GEMM kernel using CUTLASS, please refer to
[the quickstart guide](./quickstart.md).
The [`examples` directory](../../examples)
has a variety of examples.
