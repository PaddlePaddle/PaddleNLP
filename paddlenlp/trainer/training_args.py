            model forward method.
        label_names (`List[str]`, *optional*):
            The list of keys in your dictionary of inputs that correspond to the labels.
            Will eventually default to `["labels"]` except if the model used is one of the `XxxForQuestionAnswering` in
            which case it will default to `["start_positions", "end_positions"]`.
        load_best_model_at_end (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to load the best model found during training at the end of training.

            <Tip>

            When set to `True`, the parameters `save_strategy` needs to be the same as `eval_strategy`, and in the case
            it is "steps", `save_steps` must be a round multiple of `eval_steps`.

            </Tip>

        metric_for_best_model (`str`, *optional*):
            Use in conjunction with `load_best_model_at_end` to specify the metric to use to compare two different
            models. Must be the name of a metric returned by the evaluation with or without the prefix `"eval_"`. Will
            default to `"loss"` if unspecified and `load_best_model_at_end=True` (to use the evaluation loss).

            If you set this value, `greater_is_better` will default to `True`. Don't forget to set it to `False` if
            your metric is better when lower.
        greater_is_better (`bool`, *optional*):
            Use in conjunction with `load_best_model_at_end` and `metric_for_best_model` to specify if better models
            should have a greater metric or not. Will default to:

            - `True` if `metric_for_best_model` is set to a value that isn't `"loss"` or `"eval_loss"`.
            - `False` if `metric_for_best_model` is not set, or set to `"loss"` or `"eval_loss"`.
        ignore_data_skip (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            When resuming training, whether or not to skip the epochs and batches to get the data loading at the same
            stage as in the previous training. If set to `True`, the training will begin faster (as that skipping step
            can take a long time) but will not yield the same results as the interrupted training would have.
        optim (`str` or [`training_args.OptimizerNames`], *optional*, defaults to `"adamw"`):
            The optimizer to use: adamw, or adafactor.
        length_column_name (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"length"`):
            Column name for precomputed lengths. If the column exists, grouping by length will use these values rather
            than computing them on train startup. Ignored unless `group_by_length` is `True` and the dataset is an
            instance of `Dataset`.
        report_to (`str` or `List[str]`, *optional*, defaults to `"visualdl"`):
            The list of integrations to report the results and logs to.
            Supported platforms are `"visualdl"`/`"wandb"`/`"tensorboard"`.
            `"none"` for no integrations.
        ddp_find_unused_parameters (`bool`, *optional*):
            When using distributed training, the value of the flag `find_unused_parameters` passed to
            `paddle.DataParallel`. Will default to `False` if recompute is used, `True` otherwise.
        wandb_api_key (`str`, *optional*):
            Weights & Biases (WandB) API key(s) for authentication with the WandB service.
        resume_from_checkpoint (`str`, *optional*):
            The path to a folder with a valid checkpoint for your model. This argument is not directly used by
            [`Trainer`], it's intended to be used by your training/evaluation scripts instead. See the [example
            scripts](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleNLP/tree/develop/examples) for more details.
        auto_parallel_resume_form_hybrid_parallel (`bool`, *optional*):
            Wether hybrid paralle checkpoints be loaded in auto parallel mode.
        flatten_param_grads (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether use flatten_param_grads method in optimizer, only used on NPU devices. Default is `False`.
        skip_profile_timer (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether skip profile timer, timer will record time usage of forward/ backward/ step, etc.
        distributed_dataloader (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to use distributed dataloader. Default is `False`.
        release_grads (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to release gradients during training. Default is `False`.
        ckpt_quant_stage (`str`, *optional*):
            Whether activate checkpoint quantization. O0: deactivate, O1: Int8 compression, O2: Int4 compression. (default: O0).
