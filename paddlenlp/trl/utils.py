    Arguments common to all scripts.

    dataset_name (`str`):
        Dataset name.
    dataset_train_split (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"train"`):
        Dataset split to use for training.
    dataset_test_split (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"test"`):
        Dataset split to use for evaluation.
    config (`str` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
        Path to the optional config file.
    gradient_checkpointing_use_reentrant (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
        Whether to apply `use_reentrant` for gradient_checkpointing.
    ignore_bias_buffers (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
        Debug argument for distributed training. Fix for DDP issues with LM bias/mask buffers - invalid scalar type,
        inplace operation. See https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/22482#issuecomment-1595790992.
