    Base class for all tokenizers.

    Inherits from [`~tokenizer_utils_base.PretrainedTokenizerBase`].

    Handle all the shared methods for tokenization and special tokens as well as methods downloading/caching/loading
    pretrained tokenizers as well as adding tokens to the vocabulary.

    This class also contain the added tokens in a unified way on top of all tokenizers so we don't have to handle the
    specific vocabulary augmentation methods of the various underlying dictionary structures (BPE, sentencepiece...).

    - **resource_files_names** (`Dict[str, str]`) -- A dictionary with, as keys, the `__init__` keyword name of each
        vocabulary file required by the model, and as associated values, the filename for saving the associated file
        (string).
    - **pretrained_resource_files_map** (`Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]`) -- A dictionary of dictionaries, with the
        high-level keys being the `__init__` keyword name of each vocabulary file required by the model, the
        low-level being the `short-cut-names` of the pretrained models with, as associated values, the `url` to the
        associated pretrained vocabulary file.
    - **max_model_input_sizes** (`Dict[str, Optional[int]]`) -- A dictionary with, as keys, the `short-cut-names`
        of the pretrained models, and as associated values, the maximum length of the sequence inputs of this model,
        or `None` if the model has no maximum input size.
    - **pretrained_init_configuration** (`Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]`) -- A dictionary with, as keys, the
        `short-cut-names` of the pretrained models, and as associated values, a dictionary of specific arguments to
        pass to the `__init__` method of the tokenizer class for this pretrained model when loading the tokenizer
        with the [`~tokenizer_utils_base.PretrainedTokenizerBase.from_pretrained`] method.
    - **model_input_names** (`List[str]`) -- A list of inputs expected in the forward pass of the model.
    - **padding_side** (`str`) -- The default value for the side on which the model should have padding applied.
        Should be `'right'` or `'left'`.
    - **truncation_side** (`str`) -- The default value for the side on which the model should have truncation
        applied. Should be `'right'` or `'left'`.

    Moreover, methods common to tokenizers for tokenization, token/id conversion
    and encoding as model inputs are also provided here.

    Besides, metaclass `InitTrackerMeta` is used to create `PretrainedTokenizer`,
    by which subclasses can track arguments for initialization automatically
    and expose special tokens initialization used as attributes.
