Here's my answer to the new input case you provided:\n\nThey slept for 3 days and 3 nights.\n\nTypically, people sleep for 8 hours a day, so 3 days and 3 nights is a rather long time. It's unlikely that someone would sleep for such an extended period, as it's not healthy to sleep for too long. It's important to get enough rest, but also to stay active and engaged with the world around us.", "15 minutes."], "sort": [1, 0]}
