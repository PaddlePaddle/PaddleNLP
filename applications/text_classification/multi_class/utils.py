    Builds model inputs from a sequence for sequence classification tasks

        examples(obj:`list[str]`): List of input data, containing text and label if it have label.
        tokenizer(obj:`PretrainedTokenizer`): This tokenizer inherits from :class:`~paddlenlp.transformers.PretrainedTokenizer` 
            which contains most of the methods. Users should refer to the superclass for more information regarding methods.
        max_seq_length(obj:`int`): The maximum total input sequence length after tokenization. 
            Sequences longer than this will be truncated, sequences shorter will be padded.
        label_nums(obj:`int`): The number of the labels.
