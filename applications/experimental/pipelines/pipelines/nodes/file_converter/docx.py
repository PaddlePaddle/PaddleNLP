        Extract text from a .docx file.
        Note: As docx doesn't contain "page" information, we actually extract and return a list of paragraphs here.
        For compliance with other converters we nevertheless opted for keeping the methods name.

        :param meta: dictionary of meta data key-value pairs to append in the returned document.
        :param remove_numeric_tables: This option uses heuristics to remove numeric rows from the tables.
                                      The tabular structures in documents might be noise for the reader model if it
                                      does not have table parsing capability for finding answers. However, tables
                                      may also have long strings that could possible candidate for searching answers.
                                      The rows containing strings are thus retained in this option.
