## 1. Text Information Extraction Application

This project provides an end-to-end application solution for plain text extraction based on UIE fine-tuning, and through the whole process of **data labeling-model training-model tuning-prediction deployment**, it can quickly realize the landing of document information extraction products.

In layman's terms, information extraction is the process of extracting structured information from given input data such as text/pictures. In the process of implementing information extraction, it usually faces many challenges such as changing fields, diverse tasks, and scarce data. Aiming at the difficulties and pain points in the field of information extraction, PaddleNLP information extraction applies the idea of UIE unified modeling, provides an industrial-level application solution for document information extraction, and supports entities, relationships, events, and opinions in document/picture/table and plain text scenarios and other task information extraction**. The application **does not limit the industry field and extraction target**, and can realize the seamless connection from the product prototype development, business POC stage to business landing and iteration stages, helping developers to achieve rapid adaptation and landing of extraction scenarios in specific fields.

**Application Highlights of Text Information Extraction:**

- **Comprehensive coverage of scenariosüéì:** Covers all kinds of mainstream tasks of text information extraction, supports multiple languages, and meets the needs of developers for various information extraction.
- **Leading effectüèÉ:** Using the UIE series models with outstanding effects in plain text as the training base, it provides pre-trained models of various sizes to meet different needs, and has extensive and mature practical applicability.
- **Easy to use‚ö°:** Implementing three lines of code through Taskflow can realize quick calls without labeled data, and one line of commands can start information extraction training, easily complete deployment and go online, and lower the threshold for information extraction technology.
- **Efficient Tuning‚úä:** Developers can easily get started with the data labeling and model training process without any background knowledge of machine learning.

## 2. Quick start

For simple extraction targets, you can directly use ```paddlenlp.Taskflow``` to achieve zero-shot extraction. For subdivision scenarios, we recommend using custom functions (labeling a small amount of data for model fine-tuning) to further improve the effect.

### 2.2 Data labeling

We recommend using [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) for text information extraction and data labeling. This project has opened up the channel from data labeling to training, that is, Label Studio can export data through [label_studio.py]( ../label_studio.py) script to easily convert the data into the form required for input into the model, achieving a seamless transition. For a detailed introduction to labeling methods, please refer to [Label Studio Data Labeling Guide](../label_studio_text.md).

Here we provide a pre-labeled `Military Relationship Extraction Dataset` file, you can run the following command line to download the dataset, we will show how to use the data conversion script to generate training/validation/test set files, and use the UIE model for fine-tuning .

Download the military relationship extraction dataset:

```shell
wget https://bj.bcebos.com/paddlenlp/datasets/military.tar.gz
tar -xvf military.tar.gz
mv military data
rm military.tar.gz
```

Generate training/validation set files:
```shell
python ../label_studio.py \
     --label_studio_file ./data/label_studio.json \
     --save_dir ./data \
     --splits 0.76 0.24 0 \
     --negative_ratio 3 \
     --task_type ext
```

For more labeling rules and parameter descriptions for different types of tasks (including entity extraction, relationship extraction, document classification, etc.), please refer to [Label Studio Data Labeling Guide](../label_studio.md).

### 2.3 Model fine-tuning

It is recommended to use [Trainer API ](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleNLP/blob/develop/docs/trainer.md) to fine-tune the model. Just input the model, data set, etc., and you can use the Trainer API to efficiently and quickly perform tasks such as pre-training, fine-tuning, and model compression. You can start multi-card training, mixed-precision training, gradient accumulation, breakpoint restart, log display, and other functions with one click. , the Trainer API also encapsulates the general training configuration of the training process, such as: optimizer, learning rate scheduling, etc.

Use the following command to fine-tune the model using `uie-base` as the pre-trained model, and save the fine-tuned model to `$finetuned_model`:

Single GPU:

```shell
python finetune.py  \
    --device gpu \
    --logging_steps 10 \
    --save_steps 100 \
    --eval_steps 100 \
    --seed 1000 \
    --model_name_or_path uie-base \
    --output_dir ./checkpoint/model_best \
    --train_path data/train.txt \
    --dev_path data/dev.txt  \
    --max_seq_len 512  \
    --per_device_train_batch_size  16 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 16 \
    --num_train_epochs 20 \
    --learning_rate 1e-5 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --do_export \
    --export_model_dir ./checkpoint/model_best \
    --overwrite_output_dir \
    --disable_tqdm True \

### 2.4 Model Evaluation

Model evaluation:

```shell
python evaluate.py \
    --model_path ./checkpoint/model_best \
    --test_path ./data/dev.txt \
    --batch_size 16 \
    --max_seq_len 512
```

Model evaluation for UIE-MÔºö

```
python evaluate.py \
    --model_path ./checkpoint/model_best \
    --test_path ./data/dev.txt \
    --batch_size 16 \
    --max_seq_len 512 \
    --multilingual
```

Description of the evaluation method: The single-stage evaluation method is adopted, that is, tasks that require staged prediction such as relationship extraction and event extraction are evaluated separately for the prediction results of each stage. By default, the validation/test set uses all labels at the same level to construct all negative examples.

The `debug` mode can be turned on to evaluate each positive category separately. This mode is only used for model debugging:

```shell
python evaluate.py \
    --model_path ./checkpoint/model_best \
    --test_path ./data/dev.txt \
    --debug
```

Output print example:

### 2.7 Closed Domain Distillation

In some industrial application scenarios, the performance requirements are high, and the model cannot be practically applied if it cannot be effectively compressed. Therefore, we built the UIE Slim data distillation system based on the data distillation technology. The principle is to use the data as a bridge to transfer the knowledge of the UIE model to the small closed-domain information extraction model, so as to achieve the effect of greatly improving the prediction speed with a small loss of accuracy. For a detailed introduction, please refer to [UIE Slim Data Distillation](./data_distill/README.md)
