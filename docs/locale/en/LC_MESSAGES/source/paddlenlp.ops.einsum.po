"Uses uncased letters to specify the dimension of the operands and result."
" The input equation is on the left hand before `->` while the output "
"equation is on the right side. Einsum can infer the result shape so that "
"the `->` and the result label letters can be omitted. Operands in the "
"input equation are splited by commas (','), e.g. 'abc,cde' describes two "
"3D operands. The dimensions labeled with same letter should be same or be"
" 1. Ellipsis ('...') can be used to specify the broadcast dimensions."
