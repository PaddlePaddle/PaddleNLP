"Perplexity is a metric used to judge how good a language model is. We can"
" define perplexity as the inverse probability of the test set, normalised"
" by the number of the words in the test set. Perplexity is calculated "
"using cross entropy. It supports both padding data and no padding data."
msgstr ""

#: of paddlenlp.metrics.perplexity.Perplexity:7
msgid ""
"If data is not padded, users should provide `seq_len` for `Metric` "
"initialization. If data is padded, your label should contain `seq_mask`, "
"which indicates the actual length of samples."

"This Perplexity requires that the output of your network is prediction, "
"label and sequence length (optional). If the Perplexity here doesn't meet"
" your needs, you could override the `compute` or `update` method for "
"calculating Perplexity."
