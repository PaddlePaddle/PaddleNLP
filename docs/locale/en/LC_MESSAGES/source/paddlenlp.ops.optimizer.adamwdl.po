"We use \"layerwise_lr_decay\" as default dynamic lr setting method of "
"AdamWDL. “Layer-wise decay” means exponentially decaying the learning "
"rates of individual layers in a top-down manner. For example, suppose the"
" 24-th layer uses a learning rate l, and the Layer-wise decay rate is α, "
"then the learning rate of layer m is lα^(24-m). See more details on: "
"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237."
