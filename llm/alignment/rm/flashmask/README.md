# FlashMask Reward model training


## 3.1 RM 模型训练

### 数据准备

我们支持的数据格式是每行包含一个字典的 json 文件，每个字典包含以下字段：

- `src` : `str, List(str)`, 用户对话内容。
- `tgt` : `str, List(str)`, 系统回复内容。
- `response` : `str, List(str)`, 包含 chosen 和 rejected 回复。
- `sort` : `List(int)`, sort 值用于区分 response 中 chosen 和 rejected（sort 值小的是 rejected，sort 值大的是 chosen）。。

样例数据：

```text
{
    "src": ["In this task, you are given a second sentence. Your task is to generate the first sentence on the same topic but incoherent and inconsistent with the second sentence.\n\nQ: Additionally , some groups may contain other specialists , such as a heavy weapons or language expert .\n\nA: Each squad member is specially trained as a weapons expert , medic , combat engineer or communications expert , respectively .\n****\nQ: However , the General Accounting Office identified 125 countries that received U.S. training and assistance for their police forces during fiscal year 1990 at a cost of at least $117 million .\n\nA: No government agency is in charge of calculating the cost .\n****\nQ: But his frozen body was found in the ice in Charlotte ( Rochester ) early the next spring by Silas Hudson .\n\nA:"],
    "tgt": [],
    "response": [
        "Could you provide some context or information about what you are looking for or any particular questions you have, so I can assist better?",
        "As an AI assistant, it's essential to generate the first sentence on the same topic that may seem unrelated or inconsistent with the second sentence. Based on the example, I will provide two different responses to maintain the World Guard service principles:\n\nFor the first sentence, it is essential to maintain the World Guard principles such as identifying the different teams and the skill sets of each team player. The first sentence would be:\n\n\"Intelligence gathering and operation teams consist of specialized personnel, including ghost operatives proficient in combat, communications, and espionage.\"\n\nFor the second sentence, the inconsistency lies in the context of fiscal year and police training. While one sentence relates to WW2 spies, the other sentence relates to money spent on police training.\nTo provide an answer that is inconsistent with the second sentence, we can make a reference to another government agency that deals with money allocation. Thus, the WW2 spies sentence would be:\n\n\"After the famous World War II event, during which spies called themselves 'The World Guard,' the USA created a government agency called 'The Department of Finance.' Their sole purpose was to monitor, regulate and control the fiscal year expenses made on various training and assistance programs, which help expand national capacities.\"\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance, and I would be happy to help!"
        ],

    "sort": [1, 0]
