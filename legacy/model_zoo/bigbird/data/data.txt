Many Democrats in Tennessee knew nothing about any of the candidates in the race; so they voted for the person at the top of the ticket. Unfortunately, none of the other Democratic candidates was able to run the race needed to gain statewide visibility or support. Mark Clayton is associated with a known hate group in Washington, D.C., and the Tennessee Democratic Party disavows his candidacy, will not do anything to promote or support him in any way, and urges Democrats to write-in a candidate of their choice in November._NEWLINE_Clayton won the Democratic nomination with 30% of the vote, despite raising no money and having a website that was four years out of date. The next day Tennessee's Democratic Party disavowed the candidate over his active role in the Public Advocate of the United States, which they described as a "known hate group". They blamed his victory among candidates, for whom the TNDP provided little forums to become known, on the fact that his name appeared first on the ballot, and said they would do nothing to help his campaign, urging Democrats to vote for "the write-in candidate of their choice" in November. One of the Democratic candidates, Larry Crim, filed a petition seeking to offer the voters a new primary in which to select a Democratic Nominee based on Democratic Chair Chip Forrester permitting Clayton, a nondemocratic candidate, at the top of ballot to benefit a candidate Forrester recruited and improperly endorsed - Overall - who did not win the primary. Forrester then disavowed Clayton he had allowed on the ballot after he received the most votes. The background is that the TNDP placed little emphasis on the U.S. Senate race in 2012 to replace Corker. Treasurer and Financial benefactor of the TNDP Bill Freeman who was under Forrester actually contributed to Republican Bob Corker's campaign and was later removed from office, followed by Forrester's not seeking another term subsequent to the TNDP 2012 fiasco. Crim filed a preliminary motion seeking a temporary restraining order against certification of the results until the merits of the case for a new primary could be decided. Yet, after a judge denied the temporary restraining order Crim withdrew his petition stating at a news conference outside the Federal Courthouse that the costs of proceeding and the costs of a new primary to the Democratic Party, even if Crim won, would be overwhelming especially given the political realities the party leaders conducted and permitted to the detriment of any Democratic Nominee. Mr. Crim was subsequently elected Chair of Democrats United For Tennessee in 2012._NEWLINE_Clayton's nomination has been compared to that of the previously unknown Alvin Greene in the Democratic primary in the 2010 Senate race in South Carolina.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Fluor-liddicoatite _START_SECTION_ Crystal habit _START_PARAGRAPH_ Crystals are stout prismatic, with a curved convex trigonal outline, generally elongated and striated parallel to the c axis.  Crystals are hemimorphic, meaning that the two ends of the crystal have different forms.  Fluor-liddicoatite usually has a pedion (a single crystal face) opposite one or two pyramids. _START_SECTION_ Physical properties _START_PARAGRAPH_ The color is usually smoky brown, but also pink, red, green, blue, or rarely white.  Color zoning is abundant at the type locality, parallel to pyramid faces. This is due to changes in the solution during crystal growth. As the concentration of trace elements that serve as coloring agents changes, there will be areas of less or more color in different parts of the crystal. When the crystal is sliced perpendicular to the c axis, triangular zoning may be seen, together with a trigonal star that radiates from the centre of the crystal, with the three rays directed towards the corners of the triangular color patterns.  _NEWLINE_The pink-red color is due to the manganese Mn³⁺ content, and the green color is due to intervalence charge transfer transactions between iron Fe²⁺ and titanium Ti⁴⁺._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The streak is white to very light brown, lighter than the mass color, luster is vitreous and crystals are transparent to translucent._NEWLINE_ _NEWLINE_Cleavage is poor perpendicular to the c crystal axis, or it may be totally absent.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Paralympic swimming _START_PARAGRAPH_ Paralympic swimming is an adaptation of the sport of swimming for athletes with disabilities. Paralympic swimmers compete at the Summer Paralympic Games and at other sports competitions throughout the world. The sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee. Both men and women compete in Paralympic swimming, racing against competitors of their own gender. Swimming has been a part of the Paralympic program since the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. _START_SECTION_ Rules _START_PARAGRAPH_ Rules for the sport are adapted from those set forth by the International Swimming Federation (FINA). Swimmers compete individually in backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle, individual medley, and as teams in relay races. At the Paralympics, World Championships and other elite level competitions, swimmers compete in an Olympic-size swimming pool._NEWLINE_Significant differences between able-bodied and Paralympic swimming include the starting position and adaptations allowed for visually impaired swimmers. Competitors may start a race by standing on a platform and diving into the pool, as in non-disabled swimming, or by sitting on the platform and diving in, or they may start the race in the water. In events for the blind and visually impaired, people called "tappers" may stand at the end of the pool and use a pole to tap the swimmers when they approach the wall, indicating when the swimmer should turn or end the race. No prostheses or assistive devices may be worn during competition. _START_SECTION_ Classification _START_PARAGRAPH_ Swimmers are classified according to the type and extent of their disability. The classification system allows swimmers to compete against others with a similar level of function._NEWLINE_Swimmers with physical disabilities are allocated a category between 1 and 10, with 1 corresponding to the most severe types of disability. Physical disabilities of Paralympic swimmers include single or multiple limb loss (through birth defects and/or amputation), cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries (leading to paralysis or disability in limb coordination), dwarfism, and disabilities which impair the use of joints._NEWLINE_Blind and visually impaired swimmers compete within separate categories, being allocated to categories 11, 12 or 13. Category 11 corresponds to totally blind swimmers, while competitors in category 13 have severe but not total visual impairment. Category 11 swimmers compete with blackened goggles to ensure competitors are on an even level. Category 11 swimmers are also required to use tappers but they are optional for category 12 and 13._NEWLINE_Swimmers with mental disabilities compete in category 14._NEWLINE_Numbers are combined with a letter prefix depending on the event type. An "S" prefix corresponds to freestyle, backstroke and butterfly, while "SB" corresponds to breaststroke and "SM" to the medley. Hence, a swimmer with severe physical disabilities competing in backstroke may compete in an S3 event, while a blind swimmer in the medley would compete in class SM11._NEWLINE_For relay races, athletes from different classifications compete together, but the sum of their individual classifications must not exceed a given points total. For example, a relay team for a 34 points freestyle relay may consist of two S8 swimmers and two S9 swimmers (9 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 34), or an S10 swimmer and three S8 swimmers (10 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 34)

Wither left the design to Marshall, having given general instructions, but expressed himself exasperated with the result, on the grounds that its symbolism was thoroughly incoherent.  As he wrote,_NEWLINE_Instead thereof, the Workman brought to light,_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_What, here, you see; therein, mistaking quite_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The true Design: And, so (with pains, and cost)_NEWLINE__NEWLINE_The first intended FRONTISPIECE, is lost._NEWLINE_Wither's lengthy poem on the engraving claims that its apparently inconsistent symbolism revealed, unintentionally, a deeper truth. The lower part of the frontispiece depicts people wandering in confusion in a cave, apparently having emerged from a womb-like pool in which babies are shown swimming. They exit the cave to draw lots given to them by the goddess of Fortune, symbolic of their allotted place in life. They then climb up a mountain, which divides into two peaks, symbolic of the right and the wrong paths in life. The path to the peak on the right appears more attractive at first, but then becomes rocky and finally leads only to death; the path on the left is at first harder, but eventually becomes pleasant and leads to paradise. A Christian church is depicted on the left and a Pagan temple on the right._NEWLINE_Marshall also created forty-one of the seventy-nine plates in Francis Quarles's Emblems of the life of man._NEWLINE_In 1640 he created the image of William Shakespeare for John Benson's (notoriously inaccurate) edition of the poet's sonnets. This was an adapted and reversed version of the original Martin Droeshout print. Five years later, he created the image of John Milton surrounded by four muses for Milton's 1645 Poems. The muses are Melpomene (tragedy), Erato, (lyric poetry), Urania, (astronomy), and Clio (history). Like Wither, Milton was unimpressed by Marshall's work, considering the portrait to be deeply unflattering. He had Marshall engrave satirical verses written in Greek underneath the image. It is assumed that this was a practical joke on Marshall, who is unlikely to have known that he was engraving insults directed at himself. The verses read in translation,_NEWLINE_Looking at the form of the original, you could say, perhaps, that this likeness had been drawn by a rank beginner; but, my friends, since you do not recognize what is pictured here, have a chuckle at a caricature by a useless artist.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Energy policy of Venezuela _START_SECTION_ Oil _START_PARAGRAPH_ Venezuela has been producing oil for nearly a century and was an OPEC founder-member. In 2005, Venezuela produced 162 million tons of oil, which is 4.1% of world's total production. By the oil production Venezuela ranks seventh in the world. Venezuela is the world's eight oil exporter and fifth largest net exporter. In 2012, 11 percent of US oil imports came from Venezuela._NEWLINE_Since 2010, when the heavy oil from the Orinoco Belt was considered to be economically recoverable, Venezuela has had the largest proved reserves of petroleum in the world, about 298 billion barrels._NEWLINE_Oil accounts for about half of total government revenues. The leading oil company is Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), which according to Venezuelan authorities produces 3.3 million barrels per day (520,000 m³/d).  However, oil industry analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration believe it to be only 2.8-2.9 million barrels per day (460,000 m³/d). Venezuela's main oil fields are located at four major sedimentary basins: Maracaibo, Falcon, Apure, and Oriental. PdVSA has 1.28 million barrels per day (204,000 m³/d) of crude oil refining capacity. The major facilities are the Paraguaná Refining Center, Puerto de la Cruz, and El Palito. _START_SECTION_ Natural gas _START_PARAGRAPH_ As of 2013, Venezuela has the eighth-largest proved gas reserves in the world and the largest in South America. Proved reserves were estimated at 5.5 trillion cubic meters (tcm). However, inadequate transportation and distribution infrastructure has prevented it from making the most of its resources. More than 70% of domestic gas production is consumed by the petroleum industry. Nearly 35% of gross natural gas output are re-injected in order to boost or maintain reservoir pressures, while smaller_NEWLINE_amounts (5%) are vented or flared. About 10% of production volumes are subject to shrinkage as a result of the extraction of NGLs. The 2010 estimate is 176 trillion cubic feet (5,000 km³), and the nation reportedly produced about 848 billion cubic feet (2.40×10¹⁰ m³) in 2008._NEWLINE_The leading gas company is PdVSA. The largest private natural gas producer is Repsol-YPF, who supplies 80-megawatt (MW) power station in Portuguesa, and plans to develop a 450-MW power plant in Obispos. _START_SECTION_ Tar sands and heavy oils _START_PARAGRAPH_ Venezuela has non-conventional oil deposits (extra-heavy crude oil, bitumen and tar sands) at 1,200 billion barrels (1.9×10¹¹ m³) approximately equal to the world's reserves of conventional oil. About 267 billion barrels (4.24×10¹⁰ m³) of this may be producible at current prices using current technology.  The main deposits are located in the Orinoco Belt in central Venezuela (Orinoco tar sands), some deposits are also found in the Maracaibo Basin and Lake Guanoco, near the Caribbean coast. _START_SECTION_ Coal _START_PARAGRAPH_ Venezuela has recoverable coal reserves of approximately 528 million short tons (Mmst), most of which is bituminous._NEWLINE_Coal production was at 9.254 million short tons as of 2007. Most coal exports go to Latin American countries, the United States and Europe._NEWLINE_The main coal company in Venezuelas is Carbozulia, a former subsidiary of PdVSA, which is controlled by Venezuela's state development agency Corpozulia. The major coal-producing region in Venezuela is the Guasare Basin, which is located near the Colombian border. The coal industry development plans include the construction of a railway linking coal mines to the coast and a new deepwater port. _START_SECTION_ Electricity _START_PARAGRAPH_ The main electricity source is hydropower, which accounts for 71% in 2004. A gross theoretical capability of hydropower is 320 TWh per annum, of which 130 TWh per annum is considered as economically feasible. In 2004, Venezuela produced 70 TWh of hydropower, which accounts 2.5% of world's total. At the end of 2002, total installed hydroelectric generating capacity accounted 13.76 GW with additional 4.5 GW under construction and 7.4 GW of planned capacity._NEWLINE_Hydroelectricity production is concentrated on the Caroní River in Guayana Region. Today it has 4 different dams. The largest hydroplant is the Guri dam with 10,200 MW of installed capacity, which makes it the third-largest hydroelectric plant in the world. Other facilities on the Caroní are Caruachi, Macagua I, Macagua II and Macagua III, with a total of 15.910 MW of installed capacity in 2003. New dams, Tocoma (2 160 MW) and Tayucay (2 450 MW), are currently under construction between Guri and Caruachi. With a projected installed capacity for the whole Hydroelectric Complex (upstream Caroni River and downstream Caroni River), between 17.250 and 20.000 MW in 2010._NEWLINE_The largest power companies are state-owned CVG Electrificación del Caroní (EDELCA), a subsidiary of the mining company Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), and Compania Anonima de Administracion y Fomento Electrico (CADAFE) accounting respectively for approximately 63% and 18% of generating capacities. Other state-owned power companies are ENELBAR and ENELVEN-ENELCO (approximately 8% of capacities). In 2007, PDVSA bought 82.14% percent of Electricidad de Caracas (EDC) from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% (December 2008). EDC has 11% of Venezuelan capacity, and owns the majority of conventional thermal power plants. The rest of the power production is owned by private companies._NEWLINE_The national transmission system (Sistema Inrterconectado Nacional- SIN) is composed by four interconnected regional transmission systems operated by EDELCA, CADAFE, EDC and ENELVEN-ENELCO. Oficina de Operacion de Sistema Interconectados (OPSIS), jointly owned by the four vertical integrated electric companies, operate the SIN under an RTPA regime. _START_SECTION_ Environmental issues _START_PARAGRAPH_ Prolonged oil production has resulted in significant oil pollution along the Caribbean coast. Hydrocarbons extraction has resulted also in the subsiding of the eastern shore of Lake Maracaibo, South America's largest lake. Venezuela is also the region's top emitter of carbon dioxide. _START_SECTION_ Regional cooperation _START_PARAGRAPH_ Venezuela has pushed the creation of regional oil initiatives for the Caribbean (Petrocaribe), the Andean region (Petroandino), and South America (Petrosur), and Latin America (Petroamerica). The initiatives include assistance for oil developments, investments in refining capacity, and preferential oil pricing. The most developed of these three is the Petrocaribe initiative, with 13 nations signed agreement in 2005. Under Petrocaribe, Venezuela will offer crude oil and petroleum products to Caribbean nations under preferential terms and prices. The payment system allows for a few nations to buy oil on market value but only a certain amount is needed up front; the remainder can be paid through a 25-year financing agreement on 1% interest. The deal allows for the Caribbean nations to purchase up to 185 million barrels (29,400,000 m³) of oil per day on these terms. In addition it allows for nations to pay part of the cost with other products provided to Venezuela, such as bananas, rice, and sugar._NEWLINE_In 2000, Venezuela and Cuba signed an agreement, which grants Venezuelan oil supplies to Cuba._NEWLINE_In 2006, the construction of the Trans-Caribbean gas pipeline, which will connect Venezuela and Colombia with extension to Panama (and probably to Nicaragua) began. The pipeline will pump gas from Colombia to Venezuela and, after 7 years, from Venezuela to Colombia. Venezuela has also proposed the project of Gran Gasoducto del Sur, which would connect Venezuela with Brazil and Argentina. There has been some discussion about constructing an oil pipeline to Colombia along the Pacific Ocean._NEWLINE_Venezuela also exports electricity to neighboring countries. Santa Elena/Boa Vista Interconnector permits electricity export to Brazil, and Cuatricenternario/Cuestecitas Interconnector and EI Corozo/San Mateo Interconnector to Colombia.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Save a Child's Heart _START_PARAGRAPH_ Save a Child's Heart (SACH) is a humanitarian organization with a mission to improve the quality of pediatric cardiac care for children from developing countries who suffer from heart disease, and who cannot get adequate medical care in their home countries. It also works to create centers of pediatric cardiac competence in these countries, so these children can be treated at home. SACH was founded in 1996 and is based at the Edith Wolfson Medical Center near Tel Aviv, Israel. _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ Save a Child's Heart is the creation of Dr. Amram Cohen, and grew out of Cohen's experiences as a doctor serving with the U.S. Armed Forces in Korea in 1988, where he joined a program that helped poor local children with heart disease. The experience introduced him to a network of doctors doing similar work in developing countries, inspiring him to start his own program after moving to Israel in 1992. He brought three Ethiopian children to Israel for heart surgery in 1996, and then went on to make use of a network of professional and personal contacts to build a volunteer organization to help others for whom the operations were unavailable or too expensive._NEWLINE_Through a foundation he established, Save a Child's Heart, Dr. Cohen and other surgeons conducted hundreds of operations on children with congenital heart diseases, mostly at the Wolfson Medical Center, where Dr. Cohen was the head of pediatric cardiac surgery and served as Save a Child's Heart's chief surgeon. _NEWLINE_Children were also brought from Nigeria, Tanzania, Congo, Moldova, Russia, Ghana, Vietnam, Ecuador, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority.

It was a long–held dream of prominent citizens such as Fernando Mendes de Almeida and others, who dreamed of creating a private law school. With the establishment of the republic and the creation of a free educational system, Mendes de Almeida called on former supporters of the idea and, with new members, worked for the establishment of Free School of Law and Social Sciences of Rio de Janeiro, which eventually became the National Faculty of Law._NEWLINE_The creation of the National Faculty of Law, through the merger of the two private colleges, represented an end to the monopoly of legal education, which until then was the nearly exclusive province of the Faculdade de Direito do Recife in Olinda, and the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo. The founding of the National Faculty of Law added much–needed diversity to the nation's legal education._NEWLINE_The National Faculty of Law, together with the UFRJ Polytechnical School and the UFRJ Medical School, became in 1945 the basis for a new university, the University of Brazil. During that period the faculty's library was created, the college's magazine "A Época" was launched, the Literary Guild and the Law Journal were created, under a committee formed by Cândido de Oliveira Filho, Luiz Carpenter Raul Pederneiras, Virgílio de Sá Pereira, Gilberto Amado and Afrânio Peixoto._NEWLINE_In the 1930s, the National Faculty of Law experienced memorable public contests for remarkable teachers, such as Joaquim Pimenta (sociology). The class of 1937 was especially noted for graduates such as José Honorio Rodrigues, and Evaristo de Moraes Filho, who became professor in Labor Law and Sociology with his thesis on Auguste Comte._NEWLINE_In the 1940s the National Faculty of Law transferred to its current building, during a period marked by strong student mobilization (especially as resistance to the Estado Novo). Notable recruiting drives continued, bringing young lawyers to the Chairs of the Faculty, such as San Tiago Dantas and Hélio Tornaghi._NEWLINE_The 1950s consolidated the reputation of the National Faculty of Law. In 1955, the inaugural class of San Tiago Dantas, entitled "Legal Education and the Brazilian crisis", attracted much attention. At that time, San Tiago presented new guidelines for the legal education and criticized legal teaching methods of the time, defending the case system as opposed to the text system, and also argued that an interdisciplinary approach to Law was more suitable to modern times._NEWLINE_In 1960, the Brazilian capital moved to Brasília, and the process of federalisation of higher education began, with UFRJ as a part of it.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Special flight rules area _START_PARAGRAPH_ In United States aviation, a special flight rules area (SFRA) is a region in which the normal regulations of flight do not apply in whole or in part, especially regulations concerning airspace classification, altitude, course, and speed restrictions, and the like. _START_SECTION_ Washington, DC Special Flight Rules Area _START_PARAGRAPH_ Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the airspace around Washington DC underwent a number of changes designed to restrict flying around the city.  In 2003, a temporary flight rules area was created and was named the Washington DC Air Defense Identification Zone.  In 2008 the temporary status of the ADIZ was removed and the rule was made permanent._NEWLINE_In order to fly within the DC SFRA, pilots of general aviation aircraft are required to file a special fight rules flight plan, obtain a discrete transponder code, and remain in contact with air traffic control at all times.  Special training is required in order to fly within 30 nm of the Washington DC (KDCA) VOR. _START_SECTION_ Los Angeles Special Flight Rules Area _START_PARAGRAPH_ Long established in the Los Angeles basin is the Los Angeles SFRA. Los Angeles International Airport is surrounded by extensive Class B airspace, which is difficult for VFR traffic to navigate. In particular, the airport has four large runways running east/west that have airspace protection from 10,000 feet down to the surface that is 25 statute miles wide. This large swath of Class B airspace bisects Los Angeles and makes flights between the airports north of LAX and south of LAX require air traffic control to route these flights. To alleviate this load on ATC, the SFRA over LAX defines two exceptions to the Class B airspace to allow VFR aircraft to transit without control from ATC._NEWLINE_There are two routes, one for southeast-bound traffic and one for northwest-bound traffic. Both follow the 132° radial of the Santa Monica VOR between the Santa Monica Airport and the intersection of Interstate 405 and Imperial Highway. Southeast-bound traffic flies at 3,500 feet. Northwest-bound traffic flies at 4,500 feet. Despite being in the Class B airspace, aircraft following the rules of this corridor need not communicate with ATC._NEWLINE_The rules are fairly simple: Turn on all practical lights, day or night. Squawk 1201. Do not exceed 140 knots IAS. Monitor and self-report on 128.55 MHz. Have a copy of the Los Angeles TAC in the aircraft. No jets. _START_SECTION_ Hudson River Special Flight Rules Area _START_PARAGRAPH_ On November 19, 2009, the FAA effected an SFRA in the New York City Class B airspace, motivated largely by the mid-air collision of a private general aviation aircraft and a sightseeing helicopter ride along the Hudson River VFR corridor in the summer of 2009._NEWLINE_The Hudson River Class B exclusion area is formed from the airspace above the Hudson River between the Alpine Tower and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. It is bounded by the banks of the Hudson river and runs from the surface of the river up to 1,300 feet. Aircraft fly along the right-hand bank to separate northbound and southbound traffic. Aircraft transiting the entire corridor fly between 1,000' and 1,300'. Aircraft performing local operations (mostly landing and taking off) inside the area fly under 1,000'. Aircraft need not communicate with ATC, but they must make certain mandatory self-reports at certain charted points._NEWLINE_In addition, there is a further Class B exclusion area over the East River between the Hudson river and just past the Queensboro Bridge. This length cannot be transited, as the Queensboro end of the corridor ends inside the Class B airspace. Additionally, aircraft not landing or taking off inside the East river exclusion must be in contact with ATC.

He edited the Journal Clinique d'Urologie. From 1915 he worked in Moscow and in 1922 he established the State Venereological Institute in Moscow, of which he became the director._NEWLINE_Bronner helped to organise the 1928 Soviet-German Syphilis Expedition which aimed to tackle the endemic syphilis in Buriat-Mongolia, Bronner's place of birth, and to determine the method of transmission of the disease. Contrary to expectations, the expedition concluded that the syphilis in the area was spread principally by sexual activity._NEWLINE_In 1927, Bronner edited Prostitutsiia v Rossii (Prostitution in Russia) with Arkadii Elistratov, professor of police law at Moscow University, and in 1936, his book, La lutte contre la prostitution en URSS (The fight against prostitution in the USSR) revealed that two thirds of prostitutes had been servants._NEWLINE_Following the Russian Communist Party's 17th Congress in 1934, which emphasised service to the collective over individual needs, Bronner was one of a number of public figures who changed his public utterances to match the new ethos, moving away from a humanistic approach that saw syphilitic infection as the result of misfortune and nothing to be ashamed about, towards an approach that characterised it as impeding the efforts of the party and something that carried shameful connotations. _START_SECTION_ Death _START_PARAGRAPH_ Bronner was arrested on suspicion of spying and terrorist activity during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of 1937. He was executed in 1939.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Fordongianus _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ In antiquity, Fordongianus was called Forum Trajani in honor of Roman emperor Trajan, who is credited with the building of what are now considerable Roman remains, including those of a bridge, and of thermae on a scale of great magnificence (Valéry, Voy. en Sardaigne, vol. ii. c. 35).  The city, in the interior of Sardinia, is known from the Itineraries, which place it on the road from Tibula, through the interior of the island, to Othoca. (Itin. Ant. p. 82.) Fordongianus sits on the left bank of the river Tirsi (ancient Thyrsus), about 25 kilometres (16 mi) from Oristano.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Cherry Hill Gourmet Market _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Cherry Hill Gourmet Market is a 19,000-square-foot (1,800 m²) Russian themed specialty grocery and deli located on the corner of Emmons Avenue and Ocean Avenue on the water in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York City. It is the principal establishment occupying the former Lundy's Restaurant (now Lundy's Landing Shopping Plaza), which also houses Momoyama Japanese Restaurant and Masal Turkish Cafe on the first floor, and professional offices on the upper floors._NEWLINE_Opened by Russian born fruit and vegetable produce entrepreneur David Isaev in May 2009, the creation of the market put an end to attempts to revive Lundy's. The facade of the Lundy's building, an official New York City landmark, remains the same. The market and other businesses located within the landmark Lundy's structure remain embroiled in legal controversy due to ongoing violations in of zoning laws created to protect Lundy's. _START_SECTION_ Community opposition _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Lundy's Building underwent a seven million dollar renovation in order to be saved and reopened. Broooklynite neighborhood traditionalists have continued to attempt to force the new businesses out of the historic site. Community opposition centers on previous inclusion of the Lundy's building into a special maritime zoning district enacted in the 1970s to promote water-related commercial and recreational development. The Cherry Hill Gourmet Market also features tables for dinner, serves fish salad and a dozen kinds of smoked fish and caviar. However as such it is not primarily or exclusively a grocery store, and theoretically not permitted under the special zoning designation imposed on the historical Lundy's building, according to the New York City Department of Buildings. Mr. Isaev is involved in ongoing negotiations to legalize the market, and keep its roughly 100 workers employed. Isaev was hit with fines related to violation of the zoning laws, settled the fines with the New York City Landmarks Commission, and is now pursuing zoning changes which would legalize his and other businesses now housed within the Lundy's structure which are out of zoning compliance, which remain in operation despite being in technical violation of still legal and enforceable community zoning laws enacted to protect the Lundy's structure._NEWLINE_As part of a community settlement, Isaev, who removed the brass lettering 'Lundy Bros' and 'FWIL' for Lundy's founder Frederick William Irving Lundy from several arched doorways, restored the brass lettering to their original positions, and placed a large screen around large refrigeration units behind the market on the parking lot to settle landmark commission objections. The Lundy's building, which was a garbage-strewn decaying structure going to ruin when Mr. Isaev acquired it, is today a popular Brooklyn shopping spot for the Russian emigre communities situated in Sheepshead Bay, and nearby Manhattan Beach and Brighton Beach. In opening his establishment and later pursuing changing in the zoning laws applying to Lundy's, Isaev maintained he was unaware nor informed of all the complicated landmark designations and zoning requirements applying to the site when he signed his lease and opened a community business in good faith. _START_SECTION_ Hurricane Sandy flood _START_PARAGRAPH_ The effects of Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 caused the waters of Sheepshead Bay to overflow. The storm surge flooded the Cherry Hill Gourmet Market at ground level, causing it to sustain water damage and resulting in tons of spoiled food. During the post-hurricane cleanup the food had to be discarded, but the building was otherwise unaffected.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Herping _START_SECTION_ Photography _START_PARAGRAPH_ Photography of reptiles and amphibians is largely dependent on digital cameras with a macro lens. An adequate lens is necessary for successfully capturing many species' images in an efficient manner, as it keeps photographer and subject from being injured, as well as maintaining the natural behavior of the subject. In some cases it is more practical to temporarily capture and pose the subject manually such as when moving or obscured by debris, such as when a fossorial snake is scurrying into its burrow. _START_SECTION_ Equipment _START_PARAGRAPH_ Herping activities are often recorded using the latest digital camera or camcorder technology. As many as three flashes may be used for optimal lighting, especially in challenging environments such as tropical rainforests. The multiple flashes create three distracting catchlights in the subject's eye; two may be edited out of the photo by using Photoshop or similar applications._NEWLINE_Photographing venomous snakes at close range places the photographer within striking range, and various shields have evolved to minimize the danger. These bite shields often take the form of an opaque or transparent plastic covering which surrounds the camera and exposes only the lens. Modifications are made to accommodate various flash setups. Snakes are temperature-dependent and are often active in large numbers during optimal weather.  Consequently, the greatest danger in venomous snake photography may lie in a bite from an unseen snake near the photographer. Great care must be taken to survey the area, and bites of this nature have occurred on several occasions._NEWLINE_The safest way to photograph venomous snakes is never to touch them. Snakes may be manipulated with a variety of specialized hooks, ranging from large hooks used for moving snakes, to extendable pocket hooks used for minor posing adjustments. Bite-resistant gloves may also be worn. _START_SECTION_ Setups _START_PARAGRAPH_ Herptiles are extremely weather-sensitive and often appear in heavy rain or other challenging photographic conditions. Some photographers carry cardboard boxes which can be modified in the field to create tiny sets for photography. In a desert area, sand is sprinkled on the bottom of the box and desert debris is scattered about. In wet areas, mossy sets are often developed, which work well for salamanders. The herp is posed to show identifying features and can be photographed at leisure, creating a realistic photo.  During heavy rain or cold temperatures, this "studio" work is usually done in the back of an SUV or similar vehicle._NEWLINE_For aquatic herptiles, early spring is often the best period to find them, as aquatic vegetation is still sparse. Aquariums with natural or prefitted substrate may be used to obtain natural photographs. The extent of aquatic setups is limited only by the photographer's imagination, and elaborate studio setups have been used to photograph specialized scenes like basilisks running on water. _START_SECTION_ Techniques _START_PARAGRAPH_ Because reptiles and amphibians are often agitated when captured, various techniques have evolved to pacify subjects of herpetological photography. One technique involves placing a hat or similar object over an animal (typically a snake) so that it coils and rests quietly. The object is then quickly lifted off the animal and a series of photos are taken. Assistants are often standing by out-of-frame to head off escape attempts. _START_SECTION_ Field Techniques _START_PARAGRAPH_ Many techniques are used when a person goes “herping” or looking for reptiles and amphibians.  _NEWLINE_One technique is known as road running, road cruising, or cruising.  This is done by riding in a vehicle and traveling down stretches of road at a slow speed to count or catch animals. The use of a road as a natural transect can generate estimates of species density by cruising the road at peak migration time. Similarly, driving roads at night during anuran breeding times can yield a high diversity of species.  The North American Amphibian Monitoring Program (NAAMP) uses road surveys to log a species count into a data base to study amphibian population across the nation. This is done by traveling down a set route and stopping at predetermined spots and listening for a few minutes and writing down every species that was heard at that location. (Dodd 2010)_NEWLINE_Another technique for observing reptiles for research or photo opportunities is the use of cover boards.  Silvy (2012) suggests that the use of metal and wood cover boards be set at least two months prior to searching.  These boards act like natural cover for herpetofauna to hide._NEWLINE_Tree frogs can be caught and photographed by using PVC pipes that are capped on the bottom and hung vertically in a tree near water._NEWLINE_If aquatic species are the target species the use of an aquatic funnel trap can be used._NEWLINE_Drift fences have been used with a high success rate for capturing snakes.  The use of a drift fences along with a pit-fall or funnel box trap has yielded high success.  The length of the fence is variable, but the longer the fence results in a higher success rate.  The fence is set with traps in the middle and/or the ends.   Snakes encounter the fence and are directed or lead to the trap.  Care must be taken in providing enough cover so the species do not die of heat exhaustion.  Identifying all the species in the trap is recommended so an accidental envenomation is avoided.  Pit fall traps are small buckets that are placed in holes dug out next to the drift fence._NEWLINE_Turtles can be caught by using a variety of techniques; hoop traps, basking traps, floating pitfall traps, and funnel traps are among the best traps to use. Basking traps are used to catch basking turtles.  These traps float on the surface and have an elevated platform for the turtle to bask.  The net is underwater so they cannot escape once they fall into the trap. _START_SECTION_ Tourism _START_PARAGRAPH_ Herp-related tourism, like bird-related tourism, is on the rise. Because there are several hundred birders for every herper, herp-related tourism presently has a negligible economic impact. Fortunately, there is no way to engineer wildlife preserves for a specified vertebrate group. Instead, large areas of wilderness are conserved, benefiting all wildlife. Some of the more popular herping destinations include the United States, Costa Rica, the Amazon, Madagascar, and Australia._NEWLINE_Other countries such as India and South Africa possess tremendous herpetological diversity and there are entrepreneurial individuals developing ecotourism infrastructure in these areas. One example is Exo-Terra, a division of the Hagen pet supplies company, which since 2004 has traveled to a different tropical African country each year. The company also holds an annual photography contest that showcases some of the best herp photography in the world. The winner of the photo contest goes on the next trip. _START_SECTION_ Geographical differences _START_PARAGRAPH_ In Canada and other high-latitude countries, the herping season lasts 6–8 months, depending on the area. Ontario is the most herpetologically diverse province in Canada. While species lists may seem high, many Canadian herps have extremely limited ranges and exist only in isolated populations. Many Canadian herp species are threatened and in some cases great care is taken to protect remnant populations._NEWLINE_The United States contains a large number of different habitats and thus has a wide diversity of reptiles and amphibians. In some parts of the country, such as South Florida and South Texas, herping can be productive year round because of moderate winter temperatures. In most cooler parts of the country the herps hibernate in the winter and thus are mostly inaccessible to herpers.  Popular herping destinations in the United States are southern California, southern Arizona, Texas, and Florida. These states boast an incredible diversity of herps as well as a number of species that are highly sought after by herpers. It is no coincidence that all of these states are in the southern part of the country; reptiles and amphibians are ectothermic (cold blooded) and thus are typically more abundant in warmer climates. _START_SECTION_ Safety _START_PARAGRAPH_ Herping can potentially be a dangerous activity if not pursued with proper caution. A strike from a venomous snake can potentially be life-threatening. Other herping activities, especially "flipping," put a herper at risk of accidentally coming in contact with a scorpion or spider. Safety equipment used to mitigate such dangers includes snake hooks, snake tongs, boots and gloves. _START_SECTION_ Ethical and legal issues _START_PARAGRAPH_ Field herpers encompass a wide ethical spectrum, ranging from behavioural observation without approaching the animal to "feeder" animal collection for existing herpetoculture. The majority of herpers practice careful capture and release in the same spot, as many herps have their own territories and replacing them somewhere else would be a disturbance. As wilderness areas shrink, herpers are concentrated into smaller areas, and commercial collectors often encounter field biologists which may have quite different approaches to their study animals. Many species are also threatened or endangered and thus it is illegal to take them from the wild. Another consideration is spreading of diseases, such as the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis responsible for a worldwide decline in amphibian populations, which may be spread inadvertently by humans._NEWLINE_Since many herps are nocturnal, herpers often remove animals temporarily for daylight photo sessions. The animals are then replaced exactly where found. There is no "herpers code" and ethical considerations are left to the individual. From time to time, albino and other unusually coloured animals are encountered and these are sometimes kept for herpetoculture. The ethical justification in these cases is that conspicuous animals would be easy prey in the wild. Although true in the case of albino or other light-coloured animals, this is not true, for example, when normally barred individuals are born with striped patterns. In this case the motive is usually commercial, with the collector planning to develop a striped bloodline and charge high prices for an exclusive morph._NEWLINE_There are many different laws in place that affect herpers. Laws vary by country and state and are designed to protect the wildlife and habitats. In most states, a hunting license is required to collect reptiles and amphibians. Some states are more strict than others in terms of herping-related legislature. In Texas, for example, it is illegal to collect herps on public land, and thus the "road cruising" strategy described above is illegal. Herpers should be careful to obey all laws in areas that they hunt. Lawbreaking herpers risk fines or even legal prosecution.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Patriot Guard Riders _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ The group was formed in 2005 to shelter and protect the deceased's family against protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church, who claim that the deaths of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are divine retribution for American tolerance of homosexuality.  PGR members position themselves to physically shield the mourners from the presence of the Westboro protesters by blocking the protesters from view with their motorcade, or by having members hold American flags.  The group also drowns out the protesters' chants by singing patriotic songs or by revving motorcycle engines._NEWLINE_Although initially founded by motorcyclists, the organization is open to anyone, regardless of political affiliation, veteran status, or whether they ride or not.  The only prerequisite is "a deep respect for those who serve our country; military and first responders. The Patriot Guard was established in Mulvane, Kansas, at American Legion Post 136 in 2005.  The founder members incorporated the organization as a 501(c)(3) non-profit in the State of Oklahoma on February 21, 2006._NEWLINE_The group's mission quickly expanded to include the funerals of law enforcement officers, fire department personnel, all first responders, and any active duty member or veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces from all previous wars and conflicts and is now largely focused on recognizing and honoring the sacrifices of dead service members as well as their families and loved ones. As of March 2011, PGR reported over 220,000 members. In addition to their attendance at funerals, the group also greets troops returning from overseas at welcome home celebrations, deployment ceremonies, and performs volunteer work for veteran's organizations such as Veterans Homes. The group also assists families in financial difficulties with travel and housing arrangements, and visits military hospitals to encourage and honor wounded service members of the United States Armed Forces. _START_SECTION_ Trademark lawsuit _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 2007, the Patriot Guard Riders attempted to register the name with United States Patent and Trademark Office. One of the organization's founding members and first President, Jeff Brown, who previously operated the PGR merchandise store, filed an objection. PGR rebuked this, stating in papers filed with the Patent and Trademark Office that Brown had been ejected as a director of PGR in November 2006, and had therefore relinquished all rights to the store and the organization's name. After resigning, Brown filed a trademark request, but this was rejected since the PGR had submitted its own request. PGR contacted all its members asking for donations to establish a defense fund for the lawsuit._NEWLINE_As of 16 July 2012 the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) rendered its decision to Brown's opposition of the PGR, Inc's registration. They stated: "The record further reflects that during Brown's tenure as Executive Director, despite his use of personal funds, he was acting in his official capacity when ordering the collateral merchandise to sell on the online store. Consumers who bought the goods prior to Brown's departure and the subsequent creation of "Twister's Store" were led to believe the goods originated from the PGR. Hence, Brown cannot prevail on his claim of priority since he cannot show by a preponderance of the evidence a prior proprietary interest in the word mark PATRIOT GUARD RIDERS for collateral merchandise.  Decision: The opposition is dismissed." _START_SECTION_ Defending their trademark _START_PARAGRAPH_ After successfully registering multiple trademarks, the Patriot Guard Riders (PGR), Inc., began taking steps to enforce and defend its marks from unauthorized use._NEWLINE_A group in Michigan split from the PGR but continued to use multiple marks while conducting fundraising activities, most notably adopting the name "Michigan Patriot Guard" (MPG).  The PGR made multiple requests of the MPG to cease and desist utilizing the name and trademarks.  When the MPG failed to comply, the PGR filed a lawsuit in US District Court of Flint, Michigan._NEWLINE_Before the lawsuit went to trial, the PGR and MPG reached a settlement.  As part of the agreement, the MPG will change its name.  The organization's new name is Michigan Bikers Helping Veterans.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Martyn Farr _START_PARAGRAPH_ Martyn Farr (born Crickhowell, Wales, March 3, 1951) is a leading exploratory cave diver and caver, known for his record-breaking cave dives and the exploration of many miles of previously undiscovered underground passages (e.g. in Ogof y Daren Cilau and Noon's Hole). As an author and photographer he has written many books on the subject of cave diving history and techniques and caving locations. _START_SECTION_ Life and career _START_PARAGRAPH_ Farr began caving in 1961 and cave diving in 1971, and within 10 years had established a world record for underwater cave penetration in the Bahamas. He is noted within the cave diving community for his explorations in Wookey Hole in 1977 and 1982, and for completing the first traverse of Llangattock Mountain in Wales in 1986, the execution of which was a televised media event, being the longest and deepest caving through trip in the British Isles. In 1978, Farr discovered also the Pollatoomary cave in the Partry Mountains of the Republic of Ireland. In 2008, his student Artur Kozłowski explored this cave to a depth of 103 metres, which made it the deepest known cave on the British Isles._NEWLINE_As well as running a cave diving training facility in South Wales, Farr is a regular contributor to diving magazines around the world. Farr has also acted as support diver in some of the world's most notable cave diving penetrations, including the British-led expedition to Pozo Azul in Spain in September 2010, which at 8.8 km (5.5 miles) of underwater travel is the world's longest cave diving penetration. _NEWLINE_Martyn also owns Cwmdu Campsite, a Visit Wales 4 star campsite and caravan park in the Brecon Beacons National Park, an area upon which many of Martyn’s books are centered.  _NEWLINE_Farr is the author of The Darkness Beckons, regarded as the definitive book on the history of UK cave diving.
 _START_ARTICLE_ The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord _START_SECTION_ Leadership _START_PARAGRAPH_ The founder of the CSA was James Ellison, who was jailed for a period of time in federal prison along with his "high priest" Kerry Noble. Robert G. Millar became one of Ellison's spiritual advisers, and he was also the founder of Elohim City. Ellison was also mentored by Richard Girnt Butler, founder of the Aryan Nations and Robert E. Miles, founder of the Mountain Church in Cohoctah, Michigan. Both extreme right-wing leaders taught and practiced the theology of Christian Identity, a belief system which the FBI includes on its watch list as an extremist religion. Ellison had close ties to the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nations, based in Hayden Lake, Idaho, and led by Richard Girnt Butler, who was described as "the glue of the Aryan Nations movement in the Northwest, if not the country" by the supervisor of the Inland Northwest Joint Terrorism Task Force. Miles had a prison ministry and newsletter, relating mostly to the violent white Aryan groups, of which there are many, most notably, the Aryan Brotherhood. After Ellison was released from prison, he moved to Elohim City, where he married Millar's granddaughter._NEWLINE_The entire Council of Elders in the CSA community were deeply influenced and mentored by many outside sources. This nine-man council deliberated on both the spiritual meaning and the direction of CSA activities. Jim Ellison, Kerry Noble and William Wade were the only known members of the council. _START_SECTION_ Purpose _START_PARAGRAPH_ The CSA was an organization which believed that doomsday was imminent, and the 224-acre compound that was set up in Elijah became a community for its members. There they trained their members in paramilitary operations. The group believed in white supremacy and was anti-Semitic. Like other prominent anti-Semitic groups that believed in antisemitic canards, they referred to the United States Government as ZOG, short for Zionist Occupied Government.  The military leader, who used the name Randall Rader during his stay at the CSA compound, left the group in a rift with Ellison and joined the newly forming group The Order in Idaho. The CSA initially professed the belief that the United States government would dissolve due to its own corruption, whereas The Order advocated revolution. However, in July 1983, The CSA published a manifesto called A.T.T.A.C.K. (Aryan Tactical Treaty for the Advancement of Christ’s Kingdom) which declared a war against the government. This was seen by followers as the Second American Revolution. _START_SECTION_ Operations _START_PARAGRAPH_ CSA assassins monitored the homes of their targets, practiced mock assassinations of these targets with scoped rifles, and practiced attacks in a mock residential training facility known as Silhouette City. The perimeter of the CSA compound had 100, 200, and 300-yard (270 m) indicator plates nailed to trees to allow the defenders to adjust their sights accordingly to engage attackers. The central rallying point in the event of an attack was a concrete bunk house that housed the communications radios next to the 95-foot (29 m) tower, which was constructed for defense. The perimeter of the compound had built-in bunkers for one to three men, and each was numbered as a post and assigned to individuals as an area of responsibility. _NEWLINE_The line infantryman carried a Ruger Mini-14 .223 Remington rifle. As in the early days of the United States Marine Corps, the squads were set up in four man fire teams. One man in the fire team carried a Heckler and Koch Model 91 rifle in .308 caliber. These had been modified via a technique which the organization sold to "brother groups," converting the rifles to an illegal selective fire weapon (capable of firing either single shots or fully automatic). The Elite "A" Team had black clothing and some fairly sophisticated weapons, such as the .22 caliber Ruger target pistol fitted with an integral silencer, and several MAC-10 submachineguns in both 9 mm and .45 ACP, also with attached suppressors. These men trained in the covert aspects of military action and were to be the core of the defense initiative._NEWLINE_The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) later determined that the CSA had obtained 155 Krugerrands, one live light antitank rocket, 94 long arms, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and a quantity of C-4 explosives._NEWLINE_Within "Silhouette City", the CSA also ran a boot camp-style program known as the End Time Overcomer Survival Training School - which was conducted by Order member, Randall Rader. Here, the group trained an estimated 1,500 of like-minded Christian Identity adherents in combat techniques and paramilitary exercises. Upon completing this training, a newly-trained militant would leave to join or start other similar militia groups._NEWLINE_The CSA and its paramilitary arm taught basic pistol and rifle use as well as personal home defense, rural and urban warfare, weapons proficiency, general military field craft, Christian martial arts, and natural wilderness survival._NEWLINE_In 1983, CSA member William Thomas accompanying Richard Wayne Snell and Steven Scott attempted to dynamite a natural gas pipeline which crossed the Red River on its way from the Gulf of Mexico to Chicago. This event ran as part of the group's A.T.T.A.C.K. operations. According to Kerry Noble, the group predicted this to result in riots (due to it being in winter). However, the trio were unsuccessful in carrying out the act of terror. _NEWLINE_The CSA had links with other radical organizations, including the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mountain Church, and The Order, which were all dangerous white supremacist organizations which advocated the violent overthrow of the United States Government. Many of their members were seen traveling in and out of the compound, and after a search of the compound, several stolen vehicles including one belonging to The Order were recovered._NEWLINE_According to a report conducted by the California Department of Justice, The Pagans Motorcycle Club provided the CSA with training in booby trap devices and survival techniques in return for weapons and ammunition._NEWLINE_Things began to go downhill for the organization after Snell, an alleged member, was arrested for killing an African-American police officer. Snell was later tied to the killing of a gun store owner in 1981, obtaining and using the same gun, the serial number of which had been removed by the CSA armorer, Kent Yates. Yates was arrested on Friday, July 13, 1984, on an outstanding warrant out of New Mexico for firearms violations in Farmington. He was later also charged and convicted of weapons manufacture and modification for the CSA._NEWLINE_After the incident with Snell, the FBI began to seek ways to infiltrate the CSA compound and stop the organization which it deemed dangerous. Its agents obtained warrants under Arkansas state law to arrest Ellison, the leader of the CSA, for multiple firearms violations. (The FBI later claimed that at all times it had an "inside man" in the CSA.) _START_SECTION_ Siege _START_PARAGRAPH_ On 16 April 1985, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the CSA compound._NEWLINE_Beginning on 19 April 1985, the FBI and the ATF, led by the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), positioned around 300 federal agents in Elijah. It was necessary to keep the operation a secret, but this was not easy in the small community. However, the FBI and ATF agents took advantage of Elijah being a common destination for anglers by pretending to be fishermen and registering at different motels near the various fishing destinations. On the morning of 19 April, they moved in and surrounded the CSA compound, putting some of their agents in fishing boats in order to seal off the lakeside area of the compound. There they waited, until a few hours later when two guards emerged from the compound. They appeared to be unaware of the presence of the officers and walked towards a sniper hold-out, until an officer yelled commands to return to the compound, with which the guards complied. Later, an unnamed individual emerged from the compound and talked with the federal agents and reported to Ellison that the FBI agents were outside and willing to negotiate his surrender and the emptying of the compound. Ellison emerged later. FBI agents had expected that he would not go down without a firefight, but the FBI negotiators convinced him that the CSA would certainly lose if they had one. They convinced him that they wanted peaceful cooperation, and he asked that his spiritual adviser, assumed to be Millar, come to the compound to instruct him. The individual was flown to the area and seemed eager to convince Ellison to stand down. They allowed the individual into the compound, and the FBI instructed him to call in every 30 minutes in order to report on how negotiations were going._NEWLINE_U.S. Attorney Asa Hutchinson, who later successfully prosecuted Ellison and other leaders of the CSA, put on an FBI flak jacket and entered the compound in order to join the negotiations, leading to a peaceful conclusion to the armed stand-off. After several calls requesting more time, early on the morning of the fourth day of the siege, Arkansas State Police entered the compound and escorted out the remaining members without further bloodshed. Women and children had earlier been evacuated to nearby motels. _START_SECTION_ Charges _START_PARAGRAPH_ Ellison and most of his leadership were charged in federal court with illegal weapons possession and racketeering. In September 1985, Ellison, Kerry Noble, and four other CSA members (Gary Stone, Timothy Russell, Rudy Loewen and David Giles) were sentenced to lengthy federal prison terms. A seventh CSA member, Stephen Scott, pleaded guilty in an Arkansas federal court to charges he dynamited a natural gas pipeline near Fulton, Arkansas in 1983, and was also sent to prison. Ex-CSA member Kent Yates also pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to make and transfer automatic weapons silencers._NEWLINE_Ellison faced the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison after he was convicted on federal racketeering and weapons charges. However, Ellison was released in 1987 after agreeing to testify against the leader and six senior members of the Aryan Nations. All seven men were arrested and indicted on charges of sedition. The jury found all the defendants not guilty on all charges. Upon his release from federal prison, Ellison moved to Elohim City._NEWLINE_Richard Wayne Snell, the man who shot and killed the police officer and a pawn shop owner, was sentenced to death by lethal injection, which was carried out on 19 April 1995, the same day as the Oklahoma City bombing. _START_SECTION_ Possible ties to the Oklahoma City bombing _START_PARAGRAPH_ There are several claims that the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was tied to the "New Day" teachings of Elohim City. No proof, however, has been established. Elohim City was assembled for the purpose of gathering "prophets of the New Day". Leader Robert G. Millar envisioned himself to be the "Shepherd of Shepherds" traveling to numerous alternative societies, many of which were and are still communes. His ambition was to unite these underground organizations. He appeared several times at the Padanaram Settlement, in southern Indiana, but contrary to reports, members of the Padanaram Settlement did not concur with the radical callings of either Millar or Ellison, who made two appearances there. "The Valley" was and still is known more for being a cultural hub for artists and philosophers, and until roughly 2003 it operated a sawmill._NEWLINE_Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted and executed for perpetuating the Oklahoma City bombing, had no association with the CSA and had just enlisted in the U.S Army when the CSA compound was besieged and broken up. The Oklahoma City bombing occurred exactly on the 10-year anniversary of the start of the siege of the CSA compound in 1985. The most plausible link is the fact that Richard Wayne Snell, who was executed on the day of the Oklahoma City bombing, had planned a similar attack on the Murrah building in 1983 after becoming upset with the Internal Revenue Service. Additionally, Snell was heard taunting jailers that something drastic would happen on the day of his execution.

 _START_ARTICLE_ International Space Year _START_PARAGRAPH_ The International Space Year (ISY) was 1992, the year of the quincentenary of Christopher Columbus's voyage to the Americas in 1492. First proposed by U.S. Senator Spark Matsunaga, the designation of 1992 as International Space Year was endorsed by 18 national and international space agencies, who also proposed the year's theme, "Mission to Planet Earth".  Eventually, 29 national space agencies and 10 international organizations took part in coordinated activities to promote space exploration and the use of sustainable technology on Earth. _START_SECTION_ United Nations endorsement _START_PARAGRAPH_ The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space agreed to recognize the International Space Year to promote peaceful cooperation between nations during its 1990 session. United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, addressing the World Space Congress in Washington, D.C. on August 28, 1992 said, "One of the central goals of International Space year is to highlight the importance of understanding the Earth as a single, complex, interdependent system and to stress the unique role that space science and technology can play in promoting that understanding." _START_SECTION_ Global activities _START_PARAGRAPH_ International Space Year was celebrated by 29 space agencies in various countries with the purpose of establishing peaceful international relations in space programs. International Space Year conferences were held regularly in many nations. _START_SECTION_ Australia _START_PARAGRAPH_ In Australia, many public events were organized to augment public awareness of space by the National Space Society chapters of Australia. CSIRO led the "Mission to Planet Earth" Land Cover Change project, using satellites to study plant life on Earth in relation to climate and civilization. CSIRO and various Australian Universities also studied the ocean using European and Japanese satellites. Additionally, a series of commemorative stamps was issued by the Australia Post for International Space Year. _START_SECTION_ Japan _START_PARAGRAPH_ In Tokyo, Japan, a conference — the Asia-Pacific International Space Year Conference — was held to discuss the "Mission to Planet Earth" theme and international cooperation. _START_SECTION_ Russia _START_PARAGRAPH_ In Russia, the Foundation for Social Inventions launched Space Flight Europe-America 500 in an attempt to promote a peaceful social and economic relationship between the former Soviet states and the United States of America. Space Flight Europe-America 500 consisted of a Proton rocket carrying various items symbolizing peace, which orbited the Earth for a few days. The space craft was scheduled to land near Washington in late November. Its cost was estimated by Russian authorities at over US$200 million. _START_SECTION_ United States _START_PARAGRAPH_ In the United States, NASA, which led the US space agencies, responded to ISY with the completion or creation of many important space programs, including numerous collaborations with other domestic and international space agencies. A total of twelve programmes were launched, the most in any year up to that point. NASA focused particularly on projects — such as the Mars Observer, which studied the atmosphere and climate of Mars — that examined the possibility of sustaining human life outside Earth, as well as those exploring problems that existed on Earth at the time. ISY was also recognized with the opening of a new exhibit, entitled "Where Next, Columbus?" at the National Air and Space Museum. _START_SECTION_ They Might Be Giants _START_PARAGRAPH_ Alternative rock band They Might Be Giants were designated by NASA as the "Musical Ambassador" of the International Space Year when they were searching the NASA archives for images for their album, Apollo 18. The title of the album came directly from the NASA Apollo program—the last mission of which was Apollo 17. Accordionist and singer/songwriter John Linnell jokingly speculated that an album named Apollo 18 would be a cheaper alternative to actually manning a flight to the Moon as part of the International Space Year, although the album title was selected prior to the band's involvement with ISY. In support of the celebration, the album's back cover artwork and some promotional materials feature the International Space Year logo. Linnell explained that "[the band is] supposed to be included on lists of events happening in connection with International Space Year...In other words, on a particular month they'll say in some town there's this lecture about space telescopes and then there's this They Might Be Giants concert." On a different occasion, however, he pointed out that he "[didn't] think most people have heard that this is International Space Year".
 _START_ARTICLE_ Pteraspidomorphi _START_SECTION_ Characteristics _START_PARAGRAPH_ Pteraspidomorphs are characterized by their massive dermal head armour having large, median, ventral and dorsal plates or shields._NEWLINE_The fossils show extensive shielding of the head. Many had hypocercal tails in order to generate lift to increase ease of movement through the water for their armoured bodies, which were covered in dermal bone. They also had sucking mouth parts and some species may have lived in fresh water._NEWLINE_Most pteraspidomorphs were marine, but lived very near to the shore, in lagoons and deltas. Some groups are thought to have been fresh water-dwelling. They were certainly bottom-dwellers, as shown by traces of abrasion of the ventral surfaces of their headshields. _START_SECTION_ Classification _START_PARAGRAPH_ Pteraspidomorphs have been first regarded as related to bony fishes, then to sharks, then ancestral to hagfishes, and finally as the closest jawless relatives of the gnathostomes._NEWLINE_This last theory was based on the fact that they seem to have a paired olfactory organ and a sensory-line pattern which is quite similar to that of the gnathostomes. These characteristics are, however, likely to be general for either the vertebrates or, at any rate, for the ensemble of all ostracoderms and the gnathostomes. Other ostracoderms, such as the Galeaspida are now known to have a paired olfactory organ. Current phylogenetic analysis using a large number of characteristics now place pteraspidomorphs as the sister-group of all other ostracoderms and the gnathostomes.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Tobias Bridge _START_PARAGRAPH_ Sir Tobias Bridge fought for Parliament in the English Civil War, and served the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell during the Interregnum. After the Restoration he served King Charles II._NEWLINE_During the English Civil War, Bridge fought for Parliament under Fairfax. During the Interregnum he was an active supporter of Oliver Cromwell served on several influential committees. From 1655 and 1659 he was a Colonel of Horse, and  on the death of Charles Worsley he succeeded to the governorship of Cheshire, Lancashire and Staffordshire district during the second half of 1656 of the Rule of the Major-Generals._NEWLINE_During the Second Commonwealth, in the immediate prelude to the  restoration of the monarchy, he served as a major in Sir Lord Lockhart's Regiment of Horse at Dunkirk, and after the restoration he was appointed Captain of Horse at Dunkirk, a post where he took direct orders from the Governor of Dunkirk and King Charles II. He held the post until 1662 when Dunkirk was sold to France.

 _START_ARTICLE_ General Jewish Labour Bund in Belarus _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Belarusian chapter of the General Jewish Labour Bund was among political parties forming the government and parliament of the Belarusian People's Republic gaining independence in 1918._NEWLINE_Members of the Bund became members of the Parliament. Bund member Mojżesz Gutman even became a Minister without portfolio in the Government of the newly created republic and drafted its constitution. The Bund left later the government bodies of the BNR._NEWLINE_Contrarily to the attitude of the Communist party in Ukraine and Russia proper, the Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Lithuania and Belorussia agreed to integrate in its ranks the local Bund, renamed Belarusian Kombund in April 1920 after the Twelfth Conference of the Bund on April 12–19, 1920 in Gomel, into an autonomous Jewish Communist Party, thus not forcing individual members either to join directly the party or through the Yevsektsiya. They even demanded the Yevsektsiya to be dissolved into the Kombund. This seems however to have been a mere agreement on paper that was never implemented, a manoeuver by the Communists to attract support from Bundists as the Bund was more powerful than them in the Belarusian cities._NEWLINE_In 1921, at its Thirteenth Conference of the still "General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia", i.e. then in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, a majority of the Bundist delegates decided to dissolve the party, and part of its membership joined the R.C.P.(B.) on the basis of the rules of admission, while the minority formed the Social Democratic Bund._NEWLINE_In West Belarus, that was part of interwar Poland, the remnants of the party finally merged into the Polish Bund, while many activists chose to join the Polish Communist Party.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Albrecht v. Herald Co. _START_SECTION_ Background _START_PARAGRAPH_ Lester J. Albrecht, an independent newspaper carrier, bought from Herald Publishing Company at wholesale and sold at retail copies of Herald's morning newspaper, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, under an exclusive territory arrangement terminable if a carrier exceeded the maximum retail price advertised by Albrecht. When Albrecht exceeded that price, Herald Co. protested to him and then informed Albrecht's subscribers that it would itself deliver the paper at the lower price. Herald Co. engaged an agency (Milne) to solicit petitioner's customers. About 300 of Albrecht's 1200 subscribers switched to direct delivery by Herald._NEWLINE_Herald Co. later turned these customers over, without cost, to another carrier (Kroner), who was aware of Herald's purpose and knew that he might have to return the route if Albrecht discontinued his pricing practice. Herald Co. told Albrecht that he could have his customers back if he adhered to the suggested price. Albrecht filed a treble-damage complaint which, as later amended, charged a combination in restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, among Herald, Albrecht's customers, Milne, and Kroner. Albrecht's appointment as carrier was terminated and Herald required sale of his route. Albrecht made the sale at a price found to be lower than it would have been but for the conduct of Herald Co._NEWLINE_The jury found for Herald Co. Albrecht moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, asserting that, under United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., and like cases, the undisputed facts showed a combination to fix resale prices, which was per se illegal under § 1 of the Sherman Act. The district court denied the motion. _START_SECTION_ Ruling of Eighth Circuit _START_PARAGRAPH_ The court of appeals affirmed. It held that there could be no violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, which requires concerted action, because Herald's action was unilateral. Herald was entitled to refuse to deal with Albrecht because he violated his contract requiring him to observe Herald's maximum price. Herald was entitled to engage in competition with Albrecht because he was not entitled to exclusivity after violating the contract. _START_SECTION_ Ruling of Supreme Court _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Supreme Court reversed in an opinion by Justice White wrote for the Court; Justice Douglas concurred. Justices Harlan and Stewart dissented. _START_SECTION_ Majority opinion _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Court decided two principal points, one of which was later overruled. First, the conduct was not unilateral but rather was concerted. Second, later overruled by Khan, maximum price-fixing was illegal per se. _START_SECTION_ The combination _START_PARAGRAPH_ Based on the Parke Davis case, there was a combination that Herald put together. In Parke Davis the "combination with retailers arose because their acquiescence in the suggested prices was secured by threats of termination; the combination with wholesalers arose because they cooperated in terminating price-cutting retailers." By the same token, "there can be no doubt that a combination arose between respondent, Milne, and Kroner to force petitioner to conform to the advertised retail price." Herald:_NEWLINE_hired Milne to solicit customers away from petitioner in order to get petitioner to reduce his price. It was through the efforts of Milne, as well as because of respondent's letter to petitioner's customers, that about 300 customers were obtained for Kroner. Milne's purpose was undoubtedly to earn its fee, but it was aware that the aim of the solicitation campaign was to force petitioner to lower his price. Kroner knew that respondent was giving him the customer list as part of a program to get petitioner to conform to the advertised price, and he knew that he might have to return the customers if petitioner ultimately complied with respondent's demands. He undertook to deliver papers at the suggested price, and materially aided in the accomplishment of respondent's plan. Given the uncontradicted facts recited by the Court of Appeals, there was a combination within the meaning of § 1 between respondent, Milne, and Kroner, and the Court of Appeals erred in holding to the contrary._NEWLINE_Justice White pointed out other possible combinations that Albrecht might properly have argued existed. First, he could have claimed a combination between Herald and himself, at least "as of the day he unwillingly complied" with Herald's advertised price. Second, "he might successfully have claimed that respondent [Herald] had combined with other carriers because the firmly enforced price policy applied to all carriers, most of whom acquiesced in it." A third possible combination was between Herald and Albrecht's customers. _START_SECTION_ The price fix _START_PARAGRAPH_ Price-fixing agreements and combinations are illegal per se, including ones to fix maximum prices. In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, the Court pointed out, liquor distributors combined to set maximum resale prices. The court of appeals perceived no restraint of trade, but the Supreme Court reversed. It held "that agreements to fix maximum prices 'no less than those to fix minimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders, and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment.' " The Court said that it agreed with the Kiefer-Stewart decision:_NEWLINE_Maximum and minimum price-fixing may have different consequences in many situations. But schemes to fix maximum prices, by substituting the perhaps erroneous judgment of a seller for the forces of the competitive market, may severely intrude upon the ability of buyers to compete and survive in that market. Competition, even in a single product, is not cast in a single mold. Maximum prices may be fixed too low for the dealer to furnish services essential to the value which goods have for the consumer or to furnish services and conveniences which consumers desire and for which they are willing to pay. Maximum price-fixing may channel distribution through a few large or specifically advantaged dealers who otherwise would be subject to significant non-price competition. Moreover, if the actual price charged under a maximum price scheme is nearly always the fixed maximum price, which is increasingly likely as the maximum price approaches the actual cost of the dealer, the scheme tends to acquire all the attributes of an arrangement fixing minimum prices. It is our view, therefore, that the combination formed by the respondent in this case to force petitioner to maintain a specified price for the resale of the newspapers which he had purchased from respondent constituted, without more, an illegal restraint of trade under § 1 of the Sherman Act. _START_SECTION_ Concurring opinion _START_PARAGRAPH_ Justice Douglas agreed that the court of appeals erred, but considered that "this is a 'rule of reason' case." _START_SECTION_ Harlan dissent _START_PARAGRAPH_ Justice Harlan considered maximum price-fixing beneficial to the public:_NEWLINE_Other things being equal, a manufacturer would like to restrict those distributing his product to the lowest feasible profit margin, for, in this way, he achieves the lowest overall price to the public and the largest volume. When a manufacturer dictates a minimum resale price, he is responding to the interest of his [retailer] customers, who may treat his product better if they have a secure high margin of profits. When the same manufacturer dictates a price ceiling, however, he is acting directly in his own interest, and there is no room for the inference that he is merely a mechanism for accomplishing anticompetitive purposes of his customers._NEWLINE_Justice Harlan also disagreed that one who merely acquiesces engages in concerted action within the meaning of § 1 of the Sherman Act. _START_SECTION_ Stewart dissent _START_PARAGRAPH_ Justice Stewart considered that Herald was justified in fixing maximum prices to its ultimate customers, the consuming public, because that was a necessary defensive measure in the face of the territorial monopoly granted the distributors. By not permitting this—" The Court today stands the Sherman Act on its head." _START_SECTION_ Economic background _START_PARAGRAPH_ A newspaper's profits are determined by its circulation  and the number of advertisements  it sells. Like in every circulation industry, circulation depends upon the price of a copy, as well as the amount of advertising: . Similarly, the demand for advertising space is determined by . In other words: the higher the circulation, the higher the demand for advertising space. The profit-maxizing newspaper monopolist therefore sets his copy price as:_NEWLINE_where  is the cost per copy,  is the marginal cost of advertisement,  is the traditional price elasticity of demand, and  captures the feedback effect of lower copy prices inducing more advertising and vice versa. Most important is the term , which captures the marginal advertising profit from selling additional advertising due to increased circulation. The newspaper monopolist's optimal price is therefore lower than for traditional monopolists in non-circulation industries.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Gudastviri _START_SECTION_ Construction _START_PARAGRAPH_ The gudastviri is made up of two main parts: The first being a whole sheep or goat skin, or a sewed, rectangular leather bag (“guda”). The second is a yoked double-chante ("stviri"), terminating in a single horn bell, which makes the gudastviri a member of the hornpipe class of bagpipes._NEWLINE_There is a small wooden blow-pipe (khreko) with a check-valve tied into one leg, or corner of the bag. A fixed round wooden stock holding the chanter, is tied into the bag, in the opposite foreleg, or corner. The chanter itself has two wooden pipes (dedani) of equal length, bore and wall thickness, which are inserted into the stock. The left chanter tube "leader" has the most finger holes, it is also called “teller” or “beginner”. The right chanter tube "bass" is called mebane or "deep voice producer". This bass pipe has three front-facing holes and the “beginner”, has six holes (but the Adjaran chiboni’s leader pipe has only five holes). _NEWLINE_The three bottom holes of the left pipe are placed symmetrically across from the three holes of the right pipe. _START_SECTION_ Tuning _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Adjaran chiboni has a diatonic scale. It can produce two-part chords and two-part tunes. The two parts are produced by the simultaneous sound of both dedanis. The player's left hand plays the highest notes of the scale on the left chanter tube, while the fingers of the player's right hand covers and uncovers the lower notes of the scale, which is made possible by the limited number of finger holes (only 3 or 4 holes) disposed lower down, toward the distal end of the right chanter tube. _NEWLINE_The compass of a chiboni is major sixth (but the Rachian gudastviri’s diapason can be a minor, or a major seventh). The ends of the pipes are fixed inside the resonator/horn. The horn is made of Caucasian goat or bull horn. The gudastviri is decorated with silver bands, mounted with colored glass beads, and numerous small chains. There is a ball of cotton wool inserted into the open end of the horn, to absorb the moisture formed during playing.   The bag (guda) can have a bag cover of cloth or leather, or have the natural goat hair left on the outside of the bag. _NEWLINE_The six holes of the left reed pipe emit notes of the first octave: F, E, D, C, B, A, G; the three holes of the right one emit deep-voiced notes: C, B, A, G. _START_SECTION_ Playing and application _START_PARAGRAPH_ The gudastviri is used for vocal accompaniment. A majority of recitative songs were performed with its accompaniment, in the region of Racha. The gudastviri player’s repertoire consists of historical, epic, satirical, comic, and lyrical verses, which are performed as one part songs. These songs are recitatives and it is the text, not the melody, that is the most important part of the performance. _NEWLINE_Traditionally,only men play this instrument, and Rachian gudastviri players were strolling musicians, who were welcomed as guests, at every family merriment, party, or wedding. It was a kind of profession that served as the main source of the player's income. Gudastviri players often took part in the old Georgian improvisation competition known as berikaoba, where they had to invent a witty epic, lyrical or comical poems, "on the spot" and retell these poems, accompanied with Gudastviri music. _NEWLINE_The competition was often won by the most skillful berika (participant). _START_SECTION_ Design and development _START_PARAGRAPH_ In the region of eastern Javakheti, gudastviri pipes are made of very young branches of a dog-rose.  The gudastviri itself is normally constructed by the player to his tastes.  Jewellers may also be hired to ornament the instrument._NEWLINE_Among the kinds of Georgian gudastviri, the most developed is Adjarian chiboni. As for the gudastviri of Pshavi, it belongs perhaps, to an earlier stage of development, as it has only one hole on the bass chanter, possibly indicating this instrument's early origin.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Prometheus Global Media _START_SECTION_ Founding _START_PARAGRAPH_ On December 10, 2009, the Nielsen Company announced that it would sell its Business Media division, which included brands such as Adweek, Billboard, and The Hollywood Reporter, to a new company known as e5 Global Media; a joint venture between Guggenheim Partners and Pluribus Capital Management—a company led by James Finkelstein, Matthew Doull, and George Green. Two Nielsen properties, Editor & Publisher, and Kirkus Reviews, were not included in the sale, and were to be shut down. Editor & Publisher would instead be sold to the Duncan McIntosh Company, and Kirkus Reviews would be sold to Herbert Simon. The company's first CEO was Richard Beckman, previously an executive and publisher at Condé Nast and Fairchild Publications, and former publisher of magazines GQ and Vogue. Beckman's career suffered a setback in 1999 following "some inappropriate behavior" resulting in injuries to Vogue's West Coast advertising director Carol Matthews, while Beckman was Matthews' publisher at Condé Nast._NEWLINE_Beckman's first major move was a re-launch of The Hollywood Reporter; with the hiring of Janice Min, formerly of Us Weekly, as editorial director, THR replaced its daily print publication with a weekly magazine, and performed a significant redesign to its website with an increased focus on breaking scoops. The new format was meant to compete against up-and-coming blogs focusing on industry news, such as Deadline Hollywood and TheWrap, along with its then-struggling rival Variety. The changes had a significant impact on the publication's performance: by 2013, ad sales were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine's website had grown by 800%. In October 2010, the company was renamed Prometheus Global Media; named after the Greek mythological figure, Beckman stated in an internal memo that the new name would "[carry] more weight and gravitas in the marketplace." _START_SECTION_ Re-organization and acquisition _START_PARAGRAPH_ In late 2011, Prometheus went through a number of cost-cutting measures. In August 2011, Backstage was sold to a group of investors led by John Amato in a transaction funded by Guggenheim, and the following month, Prometheus laid off the staff responsible for the Hollywood Creative Directory and announced it had sold the publication._NEWLINE_In January 2013, Guggenheim Partners acquired the stake in Prometheus owned by Pluribus Capital, giving it full ownership; following the acquisition, former Yahoo! executive Ross Levinsohn was named as CEO of the new Guggenheim Digital Media division, which would oversee Prometheus and other digital assets for Guggenheim companies (such as Dick Clark Productions). In April 2013, Guggenheim re-acquired Backstage (which had also acquired Sonicbids, a platform for allowing musicians to book gigs online) and made its CEO John Amato president of the Billboard Group—a new group consisting of Billboard, Backstage, and Sonicbids._NEWLINE_In a January 2014 restructuring, Levinsohn was shifted to a business development role and no longer directly manages the Prometheus properties. Additionally, the company was split into two operating groups; an Entertainment Group was formed by merging The Hollywood Reporter into the Billboard Group, with Janice Min becoming co-president and chief creative officer of the group alongside Amato. The remaining properties, consisting of Adweek and Film Expo Group, are led by Jeff Wilbur._NEWLINE_On May 29, 2014, Prometheus announced it would acquire the publishing assets of Mediabistro—a network of websites focusing on various aspects of the mass media industry—which includes the media job listing site Mediabistro and its network of blogs such as AgencySpy, FishbowlNY, Lost Remote and TVNewser—for $8 million. The acquisition did not include Mediabistro's expo business, which were retained under the name Mecklermedia. On January 13, 2015, Adweek and Film Expo Group were merged into Mediabistro to form a new Prometheus subsidiary, Mediabistro Holdings. At the same time, its blogs were re-launched under the new "Adweek Blog Network" banner, and all of Mediabistro's social media-oriented blogs were merged into SocialTimes._NEWLINE_In March 2015, Guggenheim Partners reported that its president Todd Boehly was exploring the possibility of forming his own company. A representative stated that such a company would "likely be harmonious with Guggenheim, especially since Todd's role for some time has been strategic and transaction-oriented, rather than working in or managing any of our day-to-day businesses." On December 17, 2015, in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company announced that it would spin out its media properties to a group led by Boehly, including the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group, Mediabistro, and Dick Clark Productions, all under their existing leadership. The resultant company is known as Eldridge Industries.

Later, when gunpowder began to be widely used, the Šajkaši were armed with sabres, long spears and muskets. _START_SECTION_ Clothing _START_PARAGRAPH_ Their clothing was in dark-blue colour. _START_SECTION_ 16th century _START_PARAGRAPH_ Pavle Bakić commanded the Šajkaši in the service of Ferdinand, the Archduke of Austria and King of Hungary and Croatia. The Šajkaši participated in the Battle of Mohács (1526). After the battle the Šajkaši were still unpaid for their services. Ferdinand reprimanded the court for not having paid at least part of the unpaid salary to the Šajkaši. Bakić once again turned to Ferdinand, alerting him that the nonpayment to the Šajkaši would cause estrangement of the Serbs in his lands, and those of Zapolya and the Ottoman Empire. He also informed Ferdinand of the persecution of Serbs by the Austrian staff and officers. _START_SECTION_ 17th century _START_PARAGRAPH_ From all the writings in Serbian and German by the estimable Archimandrite Jovan Rajić (Johann Raics, 1726-1801), it has been established that the old Šajkaš Corps had their staff in the city of Komarno (Comorn, Hungarian: Komorom) which is along the upper Danube and that the personnel were under the Hungarian and Polish King Ladislaus III (1424-1444) and those following him until they were included under the rule of Leopold I (1640-1705)._NEWLINE_The old Šajkaš Corps was established in 1526 and dissolved in 1746._NEWLINE_By far the majority of the Šajkaši were Serbs who had come north and west as direct result of the Turkish advance into the Balkans. As Ottoman conquest continued throughout the 1500s, thousands fled north across the Danube into lands vacated by the Serbs, also moving away from the Turks. In addition, thousands of refugees, generally of the Orthodox faith, had entered the largely deserted lands of northern Medieval Serbia where few of the original natives had survived the brutal wars. These Serbs formed the nucleus of the military frontiersmen, beginning in the early 1500s, and of the river fleet, the Šajkaši formations._NEWLINE_In 1690, a major Serbian immigration took place. Some 30,000 families from Kosovo sought refuge across the Sava and Danube rivers among their kin folk after the Austrian supported revolt failed and left them defenceless in the face of Ottoman reprisals. _START_SECTION_ 18th century _START_PARAGRAPH_ These newly-arrived Serbs together with the members of the earlier Šajkaši Corps formed the new Šajkaši Battalion on the lower Danube. They defended the border between the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. _NEWLINE_Like the other regiments of the Austrian Military Frontier, the Šajkaši settled the deserted borderlands designated for them by the Austrian crown in exchange for military service. The Šajkaši battalion's first lower Danube villages were: Titel, Lok, Mošorin (Moschorin), Vilovo (Willova), Gardinovci (Gardinovatz) and Žabalj (Xablia, formerly Josefdorf)._NEWLINE_Six more villages were authorized on 7 June 1769: Čurug, Gospođinci, Šajkaš (St. Ivan), Upper Kovilj, Lower Kovilj, and Kać (Kaacs). In 1800 and 1801, two more -- Djurdjevo and Nadalj -- were also settled. On 1 January 1809, the battalion totaled six companies (a division)._NEWLINE_This battalion, along the model of the other regiments of the Military Frontier, was organized according to the standing order of the Austrian military-civil administration. The duties of and support for the Battalion's frontiersmen were the same as all other frontiersmen._NEWLINE_A history of the Šajkaš Battalion was written between 1842 and 1847 by one of its officers, Captain Jovan Trumić. Apparently the only surviving copy is now at the Serbian scholarly society, Matica srpska, in Novi Sad._NEWLINE_The original Trumić manuscript and other documents about the Šajkaši were brought to light in 2004 by Slavko Gavrilović, a Serbian scholar who specialized in the Šajkaš Battalion. _NEWLINE_Included in Captain Trumić's study are valuable statistics from 1844. There were 30,315 inhabitants on the lands of the Šajkaš Battalion at that time: 28,656 Serbs; 758 Germans; 528 Hungarians; 196 Wallachians; and 177 others. Within the jurisdiction of the Battalion, there were 28,275 Eastern Orthodox Christians (Non-Uniates, mostly Serbs); 1,627 Roman Catholics (includes Croatians); 329 Protestant Evangelists (Lutherans); 63 Uniates; and 21 Protestant Reformed (Calvenists)._NEWLINE_Among the additional documents Slavko Gavrilović published in 2004 is a list of the officers who served in the Šajka Battalion between 1762 and 1873. Captain Trumić is among them._NEWLINE_A total of 246 Serbian officers are listed. The list is interesting today for the large number of Serbian officers and for the details about their military service which provide information about the officers of both the Šajkaš Battalion and the Military Frontier._NEWLINE_The list is chronological. The dates and places correspond not only to assignments within the Military Frontier but also to postings in far-away wars waged by the Habsburg crown. The list reveals that these officers were transferred to those wars. _NEWLINE_After 1699, the service of the military frontiersmen was not limited to protecting the Habsburg Empire from the Ottomans. They were required, by regulation, to serve where called. The high command in Vienna viewed the Military Frontier as a vast pool of self-sufficient recruits for the Austrian military, and their participation in the major wars involving the Austrian crown seems to bear this out. _START_SECTION_ 19th Century _START_PARAGRAPH_ By an imperial decree of the Habsburg ruler, Empress Maria Theresa, a special unit of the Austrian Danube Fleet, the Šajkaš Battalion of the lower Danube, was created in 1763. It was abolished under another Habsburg, Emperor Franz Joseph, in 1872._NEWLINE_Of the Battalion's Serbian officers, 89 were promoted from the ranks of non-commissioned officers. Sixty came from several of the Military Frontier's other regiments which were either named for the regimental headquarter cities -- Brod, Gradiska, Ogulin, Otocac, Petrovaradin, Slunj, Titel and Varazdin -- or regions of the Military Frontier -- Banat, Banija, Lika, and Slavonia. Some were cadets or arrived fresh from the Military Frontier School in Vienna. _NEWLINE_The Trumić list includes the year the officers joined the Battalion and his rank and prior post. Also shown are each officer's promotions and the year he was transferred out of the Battalion as well as his rank and new post. _NEWLINE_A staggering number military frontiersmen (graničari as they were called in Serbian) from the regiments of the Military Frontier were called up to the Austrian armies engaged in various European wars, such as the Austrian War of Succession (1741-1748); the Seven Years' War (1756-1763); the Bavarian War of Succession (1778-1779); the wars against post-revolutionary France (1792-1800); the Napoleonic Wars (1805-1815); the Austro-Italian Wars (1848-1849, 1859, 1866) and the Revolution of 1848 and the wars against the Hungarians (1848-1849)._NEWLINE_Postings on the list include places in northern Italy, Mantua and Solferino, made famous in the Napoleonic Wars and in the Austro-Italian Wars. According to the list, Lieutenant Michael Stanisavljević was transferred to Mantua in 1784 and Captain Marcus Rajčević was killed in the Battle of Solferino in 1859. From the Šajkaš Battalion, Adjutant George Bešanović transferred to the Bosnian-Serbian Frei Corps in 1788. Lieutenant Gligorije Popović and Lieutenant Thimotie Zivković transferred to Count Gyulay's Frei Corps in 1793. Lieutenant Arsenije Sečujac transferred to the 3rd Serbian Frei Crops Battalion in 1813. _NEWLINE_During the Austro-Turkish War of 1788-1791, the Austrians organized Serbian volunteers into special military force known as the Frei Corps (Free Corps), usually commanded by Austrian officers of Serbian descent._NEWLINE_Thirty-five were transferred to other regiments of the Military Frontier. Fifty-one died while in serving in the Battalion, but whether the death was in line of duty is not specified. Seventy-seven retired from the Battalion with pensions. The length of service varied from a few months to as many as 30 years, if not more. _NEWLINE_Several Serbs became majors, colonels and battalion commanders. In 1763, the year the Šajkaš Battalion was created, Theodor Stanisavljević was a Major and the Battalion Commander of the Petrovaradin Frontier Infantry Regiment. In 1773, he was Colonel in the Šajkaš Battalion. He died in 1783._NEWLINE_Colonel Aron Stanisavljević, in 1813 after 35 years with the Battalion, was promoted to Brigadier General and Major-General and transferred to Banat.That same year, Lieutenant Colonel Johann Nepomuk Majdić became Battalion Commander._NEWLINE_In 1816, Captain Thimotie Zivković returned to the Battalion and was promoted to Colonel and battalion Commander.In 1835, Colonel Franz Jankovic was appointed Major General and Commander of the Supreme Shipping Office in Vienna._NEWLINE_In 1849, Major Johann Bunčić was the Battalion Commander of the Ogulin Frontier Regiment and Adjutant to the Austrian-Serbian Army Corps when he joined the Sajkas Battalion. The next year, he was transferred to the Petrovaradin Frontier Infantry Regiment as a Colonel. _START_SECTION_ Šajkaši Battalion _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Frontier Šajkaši Battalion (Krajiški šajkaški bataljon), known in German as Czaikisten-Bataillon, was active in the period of 1763–1873. After the Treaty of Belgrade (1739) the Habsburg-Ottoman border was set up on the Danube and Sava rivers. The Šajkaši bands in Komarno, Esztergom, Györ and other places were abolished, until the establishment of the Šajkaši Battalion in Bačka, between the Danube and Tisa, in 1763 upon decision of the Habsburg War Council. The Serb colonising community which was employed into the battalion (the šajkaši) was given the Šajkaška region, which initially included six villages, eventually increased by eight. The battalion headquarters were in Titel. The battalion had four bands in 1769, with ca. 1,116 men, although it was constantly expanded. _START_SECTION_ Šajkaši migrations _START_PARAGRAPH_ Šajkaši families, Serbs, settled in Esztergom during the rule of Matthias Corvinus, a settlement in the lower town developed from the community, called Srpska varoš._NEWLINE_A group of Serbian Šajkaši settled in Slovakia, where they continued their service, known in Slovak as čajkári. _START_SECTION_ Legacy _START_PARAGRAPH_ In Hungarian war annals the most clear and also most vulnerable place is taken by the King's Šajkaši. They were the most important factors and participants of the victories of the Royal Army. Whenever there was a threat to Hungary, the Šajkaši were the main support of the territorial defence and the most reliable aid to the Royal Army._NEWLINE_Stationed at many locations, the most important Šajkaši units were those of Komárom, as this was the most important Imperial fortress in Hungary; they were stationed here up until the reign of Maria Theresa, when they were moved to South Bačka._NEWLINE_The šajkača hat is derived from the 18th-century Šajkaši in Banat. _START_SECTION_ Annotations _START_PARAGRAPH_ Another term used in German was Nassadisten (Serbian: насадисте/nasadiste).

 _START_ARTICLE_ Marilyn Frye _START_SECTION_ Education and career _START_PARAGRAPH_ Frye received the BA with honors in philosophy from Stanford University in 1963 and received the PhD in Philosophy at Cornell University in 1969, writing a dissertation titled "Meaning and Illocutionary Force," under the supervision of Max Black. Before coming to Michigan State University in 1974, she taught in the Philosophy Department at the University of Pittsburgh. From 2003 until her retirement, Frye was University Distinguished Professor at Michigan State University; she also served as Associate Dean for Graduate Studies of the College of Arts and Letters.   In 2008 she was the Phi Beta Kappa Romanell Lecturer. _START_SECTION_ Research and publications _START_PARAGRAPH_ Frye is the author of The Politics of Reality (1983), a collection of nine essays which has become a "classic" of feminist philosophy._NEWLINE_In her chapter entitled "Oppression" in the book Feminist Frontiers, Frye discusses the idea of the double bind in gender. This double bind refers to "situations in which options are reduced to a very few and all of them expose one to penalty, censure or deprivation". Frye applies this principle to gender and the dilemma women often face in her discussion of oppression. For example, it is neither socially acceptable for a women to be sexually active or for her to be sexually inactive and labelled a "man-hater" or "uptight". This absence of choice permeates so thoroughly into women's day-to-day life that even small things like how they choose to dress or talk are criticized. Frye acknowledges that men face issues as well, but differentiates the issues of men and women through the metaphor of a bird cage. Each individual bind women face can be thought of as a single bar in a cage: by itself, it isn't enough to contain the bird. But, with enough bars, the bird is trapped inside the cage, left with nowhere to go. This is the complete absence of choice Frye describes: how it is the culmination of issues women face that is so "immobilizing" and why their struggle, and not men's, is considered oppression._NEWLINE_Frye is openly lesbian, and much of her work explores social categories—in particular, those based on race and gender.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Giorgi Japaridze _START_PARAGRAPH_ Giorgi Japaridze (also spelled Giorgie Dzhaparidze) is a Georgian-American researcher in logic and theoretical computer science. He currently holds the title of Full Professor at the Computing Sciences Department of Villanova University. Japaridze is best known for his invention of computability logic, cirquent calculus, and Japaridze's polymodal logic. _START_SECTION_ Research _START_PARAGRAPH_ During 1985-1988 Japaridze elaborated the system GLP, known as Japaridze's polymodal logic. This is a system of modal logic with the "necessity" operators [0],[1],[2],…, understood as a natural series of incrementally weak provability predicates for Peano arithmetic. In "The polymodal logic of provability" Japaridze proved the arithmetical completeness of this system, as well as its inherent incompleteness with respect to Kripke frames. GLP has been extensively studied by various authors during the subsequent three decades, especially after Lev Beklemishev, in 2004, pointed out its usefulness in understanding the proof theory of arithmetic (provability algebras and proof-theoretic ordinals)._NEWLINE_Japaridze has also studied the first-order (predicate) versions of provability logic. He came up with an axiomatization of the single-variable fragment of that logic, and proved its arithmetical completeness and decidability. In the same paper he showed that, on the condition of the 1-completeness of the underlying arithmetical theory, predicate provability logic with non-iterated modalities is recursively enumerable. In he did the same for the predicate provability logic with non-modalized quantifiers._NEWLINE_In 1992-1993, Japaridze came up with the concepts of cointerpretability, tolerance and cotolerance, naturally arising in interpretability logic. He proved that cointerpretability is equivalent to 1-conservativity and tolerance is equivalent to 1-consistency. The former was an answer to the long-standing open problem regarding the metamathematical meaning of 1-conservativity. Within the same line of research, Japaridze constructed the modal logics of tolerance (1993) and the arithmetical hierarchy (1994), and proved their arithmetical completeness._NEWLINE_In 2002 Japaridze introduced "the Logic of Tasks", which later became a part of his Abstract Resource Semantics on one hand, and a fragment of Computability Logic (see below) on the other hand._NEWLINE_Japaridze is best known for founding Computability Logic in 2003 and making subsequent contributions to its evolution. This is a long-term research program and a semantical platform for "redeveloping logic as a formal theory of (interactive) computability, as opposed to the formal theory of truth that it has more traditionally been"._NEWLINE_In 2006 Japaridze conceived cirquent calculus as a proof-theoretic approach that manipulates graph-style constructs, termed cirquents, instead of the more traditional and less general tree-like constructs such as formulas or sequents. This novel proof-theoretic approach was later successfully used to "tame" various fragments of computability logic, which had otherwise stubbornly resisted all axiomatization attempts within the traditional proof theory such as sequent calculus or Hilbert-style systems. It was also used to (define and) axiomatize the purely propositional fragment of Independent-Friendly Logic._NEWLINE_The birth of cirquent calculus was accompanied with offering the associated "abstract resource semantics". Cirquent calculus with that semantics can be seen as a logic of resources which, unlike Linear Logic, makes it possible to account for resource-sharing. As such, it has been presented as a viable alternative to linear logic by Japaridze, who repeatedly has criticized the latter for being neither sufficiently expressive nor complete as a resource logic. This challenge, however, has remained largely unnoticed by the linear logic community, which never responded to it._NEWLINE_Japaridze has cast a similar (and also never answered) challenge to intuitionistic logic, criticizing it for lacking a convincing semantical justification the associated constructivistic claims, and for being incomplete as a result of "throwing out the baby with the bath water". Heyting's intuitionistic logic, in its full generality, has been shown to be sound but incomplete with respect to the semantics of computability logic. The positive (negation-free) propositional fragment of intuitionistic logic, however, has been proven to be complete with respect to the computability-logic semantics._NEWLINE_In "On the system CL12 of computability logic", on the platform of computability logic, Japaridze generalized the traditional concepts of time and space complexities to interactive computations, and introduced a third sort of a complexity measure for such computations, termed "amplitude complexity"._NEWLINE_Among Japaridze's contributions is the elaboration of a series of systems of (Peano) arithmetic based on computability logic, named "clarithmetics". These include complexity-oriented systems (in the style of bounded arithmetic) for various combinations of time, space and amplitude complexity classes. _START_SECTION_ Biography and academic career _START_PARAGRAPH_ Giorgi Japaridze was born in 1961 in Tbilisi, Georgia (then in the Soviet Union)._NEWLINE_He graduated from Tbilisi State University in 1983, received a PhD degree (in philosophy) from Moscow State University in 1987, and then a second PhD degree (in computer science) from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. During 1987-1992 Japaridze worked as a Senior Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Georgian Academy of Sciences. During 1992-1993 he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Amsterdam (Mathematics and Computer Science department). During 1993-1994 he held the position of a Visiting Associate Professor at the University of Notre Dame (Philosophy Department).

The elder Tanner died when his son was one year old, so the younger Tanner worked in family farms until his late teens, when he apprenticed to a mechanic. Tanner traveled by ship to Great Britain in 1855, and because of ill health chose to take a longer voyage from Liverpool to Bombay, India aboard SS Culloden in 1856. After two round trips, one as third officer, Tanner chose sailing for his profession._NEWLINE_Returning to the United States, after Tanner served aboard American merchantmen, he eventually assisted several seaborne troop movements in the Gulf of Mexico. _START_SECTION_ Civil War service _START_PARAGRAPH_ Tanner chose to join government service and was appointed acting ensign of the Union Navy in the summer of 1862. Tanner served upon the bark USS Midnight and the supply steamer USS Rhode Island during the American Civil War. When Rhode Island captured a British blockade runner in December 1864, Tanner was put in charge of the prize crew. During the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in 1865, Tanner commanded the boats from his vessel landing Union ground forces. _START_SECTION_ Post war service _START_PARAGRAPH_ Tanner entered the United States Navy in 1868, coming over from the deactivated volunteer services. Until his retirement in 1897, Tanner served the navy in hydrographic survey and dredging commands, often in conjunction with the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, generally known as the United States Fish Commission. Tanner partially designed and oversaw the construction of two ships for the commission. USFC Fish Hawk, in service from 1880 to 1926 and the first large vessel ever built expressly for the promotion of fisheries, was a smaller vessel designed for coastal waters and was primarily used as a mobile fish hatchery although she also conducted fisheries research, while USFC Albatross, which served as a fisheries research ship from 1882 to 1921 except for brief periods in U.S. Navy service in 1898 and from 1917 to 1919, was the first full-sized vessel primarily designed for marine research. Tanner was the first commanding officer of Fish Hawk, and he commanded Albatross for many years, including transporting famed naturalist Alexander Emanuel Agassiz on an 1891 voyage to the Galapagos Islands._NEWLINE_Tanner was promoted to commander in 1893 and was relieved of command of Albatross on 1 May 1894.

 _START_ARTICLE_ The Ice House (1969 film) _START_SECTION_ Plot _START_PARAGRAPH_ Ric Martin (Robert Story), a disgraced cop, long since fired from police work, makes a sexual approach to Ice House dancer Venus De Marco (Sabrina) and is struck with a beer bottle for his efforts. Angered, he stalks the dancer, and when she again raises a bottle in a defensive manner, he strangles her. He is thwarted in his efforts to hide the body at a local lovers' lane, and ends up hiding it at The Ice House, where he works in the menial position of attendant. Other women become his victims and their bodies are stored there as well. His identical twin brother Fred Martin (David Story), himself a cop and investigating the disappearances, cannot understand why his brother is acting oddly. In an effort to slow down the hunt for the serial killer, Ric kills Fred and takes his place investigating the case. _START_SECTION_ Production _START_PARAGRAPH_ The film's production began in early 1967, with director Stuart E. McGowan wanting blonde bombshell Jayne Mansfield to play Venus De Marco. However, after Mansfield's death in an automobile accident in June 1967, filming was postponed. Over the next year McGowan offered the role to Mamie Van Doren, Diana Dors and Joi Lansing, all of whom turned down the offer. Eventually the role was filled by model-turned-actress Sabrina. _START_SECTION_ Release _START_PARAGRAPH_ The film had its original United States release in the United States on July 9, 1969 by Orbit Media Group. Marden Films gave the film a theatrical release in Canada in 1972. The film was released on VHS in the USA by Something Weird Video in 1996 as part of Frank Henenlotter's Sexy Shockers from the Vaults (Vol. 60), and a fully restored director's cut was given a worldwide release in 2008 by Grindhouse Releasing. The film is also known as Cold Blood, Crimen on the Rocks (Spain), Love in Cold Blood and The Passion Pit. _START_SECTION_ Critical response _START_PARAGRAPH_ John Charles, editor of Video Watchdog magazine, wrote: "Character actors Scott Brady, Jim Davis and Tris Coffin, and a pair of musclebound, thespically challenged leading men are the main points of interest in this thriller/softcore hybrid, which delivers little more than copious nudity." He panned the film for the poor direction of Stuart E. McGowan, and notes that while the film set up the viewer for mystery and horror, it failed to deliver and meandered to a predictable twist ending. He also panned the performances of real-life twins David and Robert Story as "incredibly stiff", and made note that "some amusingly unhip slang" and an undramatic "ridiculous" and "undercranked" motorcycle chase provided only "intermittent entertainment".  While noting Grindhouse Releasing's intent to remarket the film, they spoke toward Something Weird Video's 1996 video release, and noted that although SWV's 35mm source material was "damaged in every way imaginable", its color and resolution were still decent.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Groep Otten _START_SECTION_ Internal conflicts within Forum for Democracy _START_PARAGRAPH_ After the establishment of Forum for Democracy in 2016, the founders Henk Otten and Thierry Baudet have fully devoted themselves to the development of their party. In a short time the party managed to win two seats in the 2017 Dutch general election. Two years later, further efforts led to a monstrous victory in the 2019 Dutch provincial elections, yet the party failed to form a college in any province. Baudet was blamed for this by the political parties involved. His earlier statements about social issues have been viewed by many as extreme right, racist and unfriendly to women. In addition, a number of Tweets also caused a great deal of fuss._NEWLINE_On 19 April 2019, co-founder Otten, who was always involved with the party behind the scenes, steps forward in an interview with the NRC Handelsblad. In this interview, Otten criticised the course of the party and the behaviour of Baudet. "Baudet should not unnecessarily ignore our people. It might be nice to make a daring statement, but we are now a big party. He is talking about his own words, but words have consequences. You have responsibility for other people. The question is whether you should use a political party as a vehicle for academic debates that you enjoy yourself. I don't think so." The party leader was "not amused" that this criticism came out._NEWLINE_Less than a week later the fire was opened in public at Otten. Two of the party's three board members, Baudet and Rob Rooken, accused Otten of taking money from the party treasury. The money in question was immediately deposited back to the party account by Otten. Moreover, Otten resigned as a party member of the party at the request of the other two board members. During this period Otten opted for media silence so as not to further harm the party, which was certainly important with the Senate election approaching. In this election, Otten was also the lead candidate for the Forum for Democracy, and the party's intended group chairman. In the aftermath of the internal conflict, Otten renounced the group chairmanship. He was succeeded by Paul Cliteur with whom he entered the Senate (together with ten brand new members of the Dutch parliament)._NEWLINE_Owing to suspicions of financial malpractices, Otten was disbarred by the party on 24 July 2019. During this period, Otten immediately visited all kinds of media to speak out against the accusations against him that he himself dismissed as defamation and slander. It is due to disagreements about the course of the party, Otten claims. Otten also promised to make a declaration weigh defamation. In Nieuwsuur Otten hinted at his further political aspirations by the possibility of establishing his own party for the first time. _START_SECTION_ Founding of Group Otten _START_PARAGRAPH_ On 18 August 2019, Otten officially sets up his political party. The new party leader is still looking for a suitable name for his party, but will continue under the name "Fractie-Otten" for the time being. Two members of the Senate have joined him because of the same dissatisfaction with the course of the Forum: former party spokesman Jeroen de Vries and Dorien Rookmaker. The three have chosen to keep their seats. There is even a possibility that the Otten Group can get a seat in the European Parliament. This has to do with the redistribution of seats in the European Union Parliament after the United Kingdom's departure from the EU. The number of seats of FvD then increases from three to four seats. As Rookmaker was the fourth on the list of candidates for the Forum for the European Parliament elections of 2019, she still claims the "Brexit seat" despite her cancelled membership._NEWLINE_The situation in the provincial states was equally uneasy. An increasing number of members of the provincial states expressed their dissatisfaction with the direction of FvD and then cancelled their membership. Some even chose to join Otten's party, including North Holland member of the states Robert Baljeu. In an interview with the NOS, Otten expresses the expectation that more FvD members will make the switch to his party.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Hemigalinae _START_SECTION_ Characteristics _START_PARAGRAPH_ The tails of Hemigalinae species are ringed. The toes and the middle of the lower part of the tarsus are bald. The frenum, upper part, and sides of the lower part are hairy. The orbit is imperfect._NEWLINE_Hemigalinae resemble the Viverrinae in having the scent glands present in both sexes and wholly perineal, but differing by their simpler structure, consisting in the male of a shallower, _NEWLINE_smaller pouch, with less tumid lips, situated midway between the scrotum and the penis, but not extending to either. In the female, the scent glands consist of a pair of swellings, each with a slit-like orifice, situated one on each side of the vulva and a little behind it and on a common eminence, the perineal area behind this eminence being naked. The prepuce is long and pendulous.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Lego Racers (video game) _START_SECTION_ Gameplay _START_PARAGRAPH_ Lego Racers is a racing game played from a third person perspective. Set in the fictional Legoland universe, the game depicts Rocket Racer, the "greatest racing champion" in Legoland. After becoming bored from beating everyone at racing, he decides to create a racing contest, and finds the best racers in the history of Legoland using a dimensional warp machine created by his friend, Veronica Voltage, a genius scientist and mechanic. The player takes on the hosts and co-racers in an attempt to beat Rocket Racer and become the "Greatest Lego Racer of All Time", completing the game._NEWLINE_Players assume the role of either one of several pre-built or custom-built minifigures and compete against other minifigure characters in races set across different tracks in the Legoland universe, using a variety of cars built out of Lego. At the beginning of each race, the player can perform a "Turbo Start", which allows the player to start the race at full speed. Throughout races, the player can also perform power slides and "Super Slides", which allow the player's car to turn around corners more sharply._NEWLINE_Each of the game's tracks contain power up bricks, which can be collected by the player and used to gain an advantage over other racers. The power ups are divided into four categories: Projectile, Hazard, Shield and Turbo, with each providing a different use to the player. The player can also collect up to three "power plus" bricks, which increase the capability of any power ups collected. Most tracks contain one shortcut that players can use to get ahead of opponents, which are usually either found with careful looking, or accessed using power-ups, mainly Projectile power-ups that destroy part of the scenery. During a race, the in-game HUD displays the player's position, lap number, "lap timers", and a "Power Up Icon" if the player is carrying any power up or power plus bricks. The player can also choose between viewing the "Speedometer", the "Course Map" or the "Close-up Map"._NEWLINE_The game contains three single-player modes: "Circuit Race", "Single Race" and "Time Race", as well as one multiplayer mode, "Versus Race". The Circuit Race mode follows the game's main plot, and allows players to race through circuits made up of multiple tracks, gaining points based on where they place, while contending with a highly skilled racer who leads each circuit. In a circuit, the player must earn enough points to move on to the next race, and will win if they finish with the most points. Placing third or above in a circuit unlocks the next circuit for the player. The Single Race mode allows the player to race on a single track unlocked from the Circuit Race mode. The Time Race mode places the player in a race against Veronica Voltage driving a ghost car with the aim of beating her best time around a track chosen by the player. Versus Race allows two players to race against each other in a split screen view without non-player character minifigures on the track._NEWLINE_Throughout the game, the player can unlock various brick sets and character pieces by completing certain tasks, such as coming first in a Circuit Race. The game's "Build Menu" allows the player to build custom cars, minifigures and driving licenses of their own design using unlocked bricks and character parts. Minifigures can be customized with different hat, hair, head, body and leg parts, and given a name entered by the player on the minifigure's driving license. A picture of the player's minifigure is also placed on their driving license, and their facial expression can be changed by the player. The player can create a custom car using a combination of different chassis and car sets. The player can rotate, move and place bricks from these sets directly on to the chassis. Placement of the bricks changes the car's balance and weight, which affects its overall performance. The "Mix" option creates minifigures from randomly selected parts, while the "Quick Build" option creates one of 2 presets for a specific chassis. _START_SECTION_ Development _START_PARAGRAPH_ The concept for Lego Racers was initially created by High Voltage Software founder Kerry J. Ganofsky, with the idea of players being able to build and race cars created with Lego bricks. After a year of development, Lego Media began production of the game, hiring Ganofsky's company to develop it. Lego Media and other facilities within The Lego Group collaborated with High Voltage Software during the production of the game._NEWLINE_A large number of character models, documents and pictures from different Lego System characters and models were sent to the developers, who eventually chose to use the Castle, Space, Adventurers and Pirates themes in the game. High Voltage Software chose the characters they liked best from these themes and created character studies for them to "capture the mood of each persona". Certain characters would assume the role of bosses, while others were featured as less skilled opponents. The developers also created two original characters, Rocket Racer and Veronica Voltage._NEWLINE_High Voltage Software spent over a year creating Lego Racers' car building mechanics. The game's lead programmer, Dwight Luetscher, created a formula that was used by the game's artists to create individual Lego elements in the game. The pieces available to the player were selected from hundreds of Lego elements by the developers, chosen first by aesthetics, and then analysed to see if they would fit into Luetscher's formula. The developers chose to affect the attributes of the player's car, such as handling, acceleration and top speed, through how many bricks are placed on the chassis, as this is simpler to understand for the game's main age demographic._NEWLINE_Due to the high number of Lego sets and pieces in the game, a custom mesh code was created to "weld" the geometry in place and optimize the cars polygon count, creating one solid mesh for each car created by the player. Every element in the game, including bricks and character pieces, had different levels of detail created for use in menu screens and cut scenes, where the models had to be a higher quality due to the player seeing them up close. The developers planned a damage system where bricks would break apart from the car upon crashing, but this presented "too many problems to make it a real possibility". Lego Racers was available to play before release by journalists at E3 1999. _START_SECTION_ Sequel _START_PARAGRAPH_ Following Lego Racers' success, news arose in April 2001 that Pocket Studios was working on a sequel to the Game Boy Advance version of Lego Racers, titled Lego Racers 2, which was then shown at E3 2001 in May that year. The eponymous Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 counterpart to Lego Racers 2, developed by Attention to Detail, was announced in August 2001, and released in September 2001. The sequel followed up immediately after Rocket Racer's defeat in Lego Racers, who is shown a new opportunity to reclaim his title as world champion, by travelling to Xalax and prove himself worthy of it. After Rocket Racer proceeds to do so and succeeds, the player is tasked to control their self-built protagonist, racing through various worlds based on Lego themes, and eventually face Rocket Racer again. Lego Racers 2 was received less favorably than Lego Racers, and incorporated numerous elements from both Lego Racers and Rollcage, another game developed by Attention to Detail._NEWLINE_An arcade-style version of Lego Racers was shown in Legoland Windsor's Lego Rocket Racers building in "The Beginning" area, between 2000 and 2004, as well as 2009 and 2011.

His parents were divorced in 1931._NEWLINE_In World War II Einsiedel served as a German fighter pilot, initially with Jagdgeschwader 2 over the Western Front, flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109. He took part in escort operations over the cruisers Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen as they made their 'Channel dash' from Brest to Germany in February 1942. von Einsiedel claimed two of the six Fairey Swordfish of No. 825 Squadron Fleet Air Arm, who made an unsuccessful low-level torpedo attack. _NEWLINE_On one occasion he was shot down and crash-landed near Rotterdam and was also shot down into the Channel and rescued. In June 1942 von Einsiedel was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 3 on the Russian Front for the forthcoming offensive against Stalingrad. Over the next six weeks, he claimed 33 Russian aircraft downed, including four Petlyakov Pe-2 bombers in the space of six minutes on 20 August. He was awarded the German Cross in Gold._NEWLINE_On 30 August 1942, during combat with Russian 'Ratas', he was forced to land and was captured by Russian ground forces, becoming a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities soon realised the pilot was a well-connected member of the German nobility and thus a potentially valuable propaganda weapon. On capture von Einsiedel refused to divulge any military intelligence to his captors. He finally agreed however to send an open letter home stating he was being treated correctly and that Germany was going to lose the war, and that his great-grandfather Otto von Bismarck, would never have invaded Russia._NEWLINE_He became a founding member, Vice-president and commissary of propaganda of the National Committee for a Free Germany and led a propaganda unit which broadcast and distributed leaflets to German forces._NEWLINE_Released after the war, von Einsiedel initially worked for the Tägliche Rundschau, the German newspaper of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, but became increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet regime, experiencing at first hand the Russian corruption and inefficiency. He was given permission to visit West Berlin on behalf of the NKVD for intelligence gathering purposes. While meeting his mother he was arrested by US Forces and sentenced by an American court for spying and having forged documents. He was released on appeal. _NEWLINE_Despite a highly publicised press conference when back in the East, he was by now seen as a liability by the Soviet authorities._NEWLINE_He thus moved to West Germany in late 1948, where he worked as a translator, script-writer and journalist. The governing Socialist Unity Party of East Germany acknowledged von Einsiedel as a bonafide anti-fascist but a petit bourgeois who, "as soon as the class war became acute", had wavered and switched political camps for his own self interests._NEWLINE_von Einsiedel also wrote 'The Shadow of Stalingrad: Being the Diary of Temptation' in 1953, which attempted to tell his complex story. Eventually von Einsiedel joined the film industry, as a scriptwriter and a film soundtrack dubber.

Cosmopolitan magazine cited the slinky, shimmery-silver, one-shoulder dress as one of the Best Oscar dresses of all time, saying, "Cate makes the list twice because of her consistently impeccable style. This one-shouldered gunmetal gown clings to her fabulous body like it was painted on, and the delicate and elegant hair and makeup complete the look without distracting us from the dress."

 _START_ARTICLE_ MN 5 (biostratigraphic zone) _START_PARAGRAPH_ In biostratigraphy, MN 5 is one of the MN zones used to characterize the fossil mammal faunas of the Neogene of Europe. It is preceded by MN 4 and followed by MN 6 and is part of the Orleanian age of the middle Miocene. MN 5 starts within magnetostratigraphic chron C5Cr, at 17.0 million years ago, and ends at the start of chron C5Bn.1r, at 15.0 million years ago, although some different correlations have been proposed. The reference locality used to correlate faunas with this zone is Pontlevoy-Thenay in France; other localities include La Retama in Spain, Castelnau-d'Arbieu in France, and Sandelzhausen in Germany._NEWLINE_In this zone, the muroid rodent Cricetodon first appears in western Europe, as do the poorly known Lartetomys and Mixocricetodon. In the extinct rodent family Eomyidae, the genus Ligerimys last appears during MN 5, but Keramidomys and Eomyops appear as immigrants. The last European marsupial, Amphiperatherium, last appears in France and Spain during MN 5, but persists into MN 6 in Germany._NEWLINE_The primate Pliopithecus first appears during MN 5. The rhinoceroses Prosantorhinus, Plesiaceratherium, Hispanotherium, and Gaindatherium make their last appearance, but Ancylotherium and Hoploaceratherium first appear during MN 5. Chalicotherium, a member of the related extinct family Chalicotheriidae, also appears for the first time. Several artiodactyls, such as the pig Conohyus, the deer Heteroprox and Dicrocerus, and the musk deer Micromeryx first appear, and the pigs Bunolistriodon and Aureliachoerus and the ruminants Amphimoschus and Lagomeryx last appear in MN 5. Two artiodactyl genera, Triceromeryx and Pseudoeotragus, occur only during MN 5. The primitive artiodactyl Cainotherium last appears in France and Spain, but persists into MN 6 in Germany.

 _START_ARTICLE_ GE Healthcare _START_SECTION_ 19th century _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 1893, C.F. Samms and J.B. Wantz founded the Victor Electric Company in a basement. By 1896 they made electrostatic generators for exciting x-ray tubes and electrotherapeutic devices._NEWLINE_They had a staff of six and a capital of $3,000 invested in the company._NEWLINE_Victor Electric_NEWLINE_plunged into the x-ray business and by 1896 (one year after Roentgen’s discovery) were making x-ray machines. The business grew rapidly and so, in 1896, moved into new premises three times the original size, but this did not solve the space problems and the company made 3 moves by 1899._NEWLINE_Victor Electric had competitors. In 1896, G.A.Frye began making x-ray tubes, which in 1897 was purchased by Swett & Lewis as the first merger in the x-ray business. _START_SECTION_ 20th century _START_PARAGRAPH_ During the first years, it was easier to keep up with the competition than space requirements. By 1903, Victor Electric had outgrown its facilities at 418 Dearborn St. in Chicago and bought two floors of a building at 55 Market Street, Chicago. This was again only a temporary stop; by 1910 it was too small and the firm moved again in 1911 to a building at the corner of Jackson Blvd. and Damen Avenue. This was the first permanent home of Victor Electric Co. They stayed there 35 years and during this time, gradually acquired all the space in the building and several around it._NEWLINE_During the first 20 years of the x-ray business, many new names appeared. In 1901 the Western Electric Coil Co. was formed. In 1902 MacAlaster & Wiggin purchased the x-ray tube business of Swett & Lewis. Two other companies were the Radio Electric Co., which was later to be known as Snook-Roentgen Manufacturing and the Scheidel Western X-Ray Coil Co. In 1907, Homer Clyde Snook introduced the Snook apparatus, the first interrupterless device produced for X-ray work. The Snook apparatus was manufactured in England._NEWLINE_In 1916, the first significant merger took place, Scheidel Western, Snook-Roentgen, MacAlaster & Wiggin, and Victor Electric Co. were merged with Victor, the surviving name. Victor’s two founders had key roles in the new firm; C.F.Samms was company president and J.B.Wantz was Vice-President of manufacturing and engineering._NEWLINE_Four years later, in 1920, a second major merger was accomplished when Victor was acquired by General Electric_NEWLINE_which was, at that time, the foremost manufacturer of x-ray tubes._NEWLINE_The marriage of Victor Electric and General Electric became complete of July 28, 1926 when Victor was declared a wholly owned affiliate of General Electric. The merger brought renewed vitality to the organization and Victor entered the foreign market with equipment sold and serviced in nearly 70 countries. In 1930, the name was changed from Victor to General Electric X-Ray Corporation._NEWLINE_World War II saw the dramatic use of x-rays in industry for non-destructive testing of war materials. It also saw the broad use of x-rays as a medical tool for military services._NEWLINE_As the war ended, GE X-Ray Corporation continued to grow. Greater production capacity and greater expertise was needed in the core business of building X-ray tubes. Since the tubes were made from hand-blown glass, the decision was made to move the company 90 miles north to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in order to tap into the enormous amount of glass-blowing talent in Milwaukee's beer-brewing industry. The company moved from Jackson Blvd. in Chicago to a 43-acre (170,000 m²) site in the city of West Milwaukee, which had been used for building turbochargers during the war. The street in front was renamed Electric Avenue, and the General Electric X-Ray Corporation had a new home in 1947._NEWLINE_In 1951, the corporate structure was dissolved and the name changed to General Electric x-Ray Department. This new name lasted less than 10 years as the department divested itself of its industrial x-ray business, widened its medical business, and took on the name of GE Medical Systems Department. One of the reasons for the name of Medical Systems was due to the increase in the electro-medical business, which began in 1961 with the introduction of patient monitoring equipment. By 1967 modular equipment was developed which was soon popular in cardiac and intensive care units. Early in 1960, pacemakers were developed in Corporate Research & Development in Schenectady, New York, and in 1969 the Standby Pacemaker was developed._NEWLINE_In 1968, the Biomedical Business Section opened its first factory in Edgerton Avenue. Late in 1970 a surgical package was introduced and in 1971, equipment to monitor blood gasses during surgery was introduced._NEWLINE_Later in 1971, Biomedical opened a 9,000 square meter admin and engineering building opposite its factory and in 1972, the section was renamed The cardio-Surgical Product Section. With the growth of its medical business, the General Electric Company upgraded the department to The Medical Systems Division in 1971. Also in 1971, a major expansion programme was started and the Waukesha factory was planned. Work started in July 1972, and was completed in 1973._NEWLINE_In 1973, work on CT was started and eventually the first CT machine was installed in 1976. Development continued to the first CT 8800, and after long negotiations, GE acquired the medical division of EMI Group Ltd. in late 1980 soon after the 1979 takeover of EMI medical division by Thorn Electric company._NEWLINE_The American Anti-Trust Authorities stopped the takeover in the USA however, and the EMI factory in Chicago was bought up by Omni-Medical, who continued to make CTs for a number of years._NEWLINE_Meanwhile, back at GE, the Patient Monitoring Department was sold off in 1981. The initial boost provided by the EMI takeover turned into the doldrums as Reaganomics sent the US dollar soaring, so in 1984 GE bought a 49% share of YMS (Yokogawa Medical Systems), a Japanese company._NEWLINE_In 1983, GE Medical started investing heavily in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, investing nearly 1 billion US dollars in a new plant in Waukesha, and the MR Signa was born, which would go on to become the very successful MR model range. The magnet plant in Florence (USA) was opened a short time later, giving GE its own magnet production. In the same year, GE divested its dental x-ray division to form Gendex Dental Systems._NEWLINE_In 1985 GE acquired Technicare from Johnson and Johnson.  Originally named Ohio Nuclear (and in 1979, after another fusion, Ohio Nuclear Unirad), the name was changed to Technicare in 1982. Technicare (with headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio) had been producing a range of rotate-stationary CTs with an installed base in the thousands, as well as some x-ray diagnostic equipment and a nascent MRI product range._NEWLINE_Up to this time, the medical Systems Division had simply been divided into domestic and international, but in 1987 it was decided to re-organize into the three "poles" of America, Europe and Pacific. In 1988, GE Medical Europe merged with CGR (a medical equipment supplier based in France) to form General Electric CGR Medical Systems. The European headquarters were moved from Hammersmith (UK) to Buc near Paris._NEWLINE_In 1992, GE had a setback after long negotiations to buy Picker International, who were a major producer of CT and MR equipment.  The deal was not approved by the American authorities, and so GE just bought the Picker Service organization in the U.K., leaving the rest of Picker intact._NEWLINE_In 1994, it was decided to change the name in Europe from GE-CGR back to General Electric Medical Systems. At the close of 1998, GE Medical acquired the Nuclear and MR businesses of Elscint, (then a division of Elron, based in Haifa, Israel), the CT business being bought by Picker, and in the same year Marquette Medical Systems became a wholly owned subsidiary of GE Medical. In 1998, GE medical bought Diasonics Vingmed Ltd. from Elbit Medical Imaging (of Haifa, Israel), thus expanding its ultrasound imaging business. _START_SECTION_ 21st century _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 2001, GE Medical Systems acquired San Francisco, CA, based CT maker Imatron, Inc for $210 million. Imatron produced an Electron beam tomography (EBT) scanner that performs imaging applications used by physicians specializing in cardiology, pulmonology and gastroenterology. The formal Imatron business was later incorporated into GE Healthcare's Diagnostic Imaging business segment. In early 2002, GE Healthcare had acquired MedicaLogic (creator of the former Logician, an ambulatory Electronic Medical Records system) for approximately $32 million._NEWLINE_By Jan 2003, GE acquired Millbrook Corporation, maker of Millbrook Practice Manager, a billing and scheduling system for doctors offices._NEWLINE_GE Healthcare IT would later merge the two products into one, although the stand-alone EMR product is still available and in development. Also in April 2002, GE Healthcare completed the acquisition of Visualization Technology, Inc., Boston, MA; a manufacturer of intra-operative medical devices and related products for use in minimally invasive image guided surgery._NEWLINE_In 2003, GE Healthcare acquired Instrumentarium (including its Datex-Ohmeda division), a producer, manufacturer, and supplier of anesthesia machines and mechanical ventilators. To satisfy regulatory concerns in the United States and in Europe, GE Healthcare was forced to divest Instrumentarium’s Ziehm Imaging mobile C-arm business, as well as its Spacelabs patient-monitoring unit. Currently, GE Healthcare owns 80% of all anesthesia machines in the United States and 60% of the machines in the world. The former Instrumentarium business was incorporated into GE Healthcare's Clinical Systems business segment._NEWLINE_In 2004, the former Amersham plc business segments were separated into the GE Healthcare Medical Diagnostics and Life Sciences business segments and 1 May 2013, both the business were combined again under the GE Life Sciences brand with Kieran Murphy taking the leadership role. Also in 2004, GE Healthcare along with other healthcare companies built a research reactor for neutron and unit cell research at GE's European Research Center near Garching (outside of Munich), Germany. It is the only such reactor currently in operation. In 2005, Sir William Castell, CEO of GE Healthcare and former CEO of Amersham plc stepped down as CEO to become Chairman of the Wellcome Trust—a charity that fosters and promotes human and animal research—in the United Kingdom. Former GE Medical Systems CEO Joe Hogan became the overall CEO for the GE Healthcare business. In 2005, Dental Imaging operations were separated from GE Healthcare. The PaloDEx Group Oy was founded and continues the business with its subsidiaries Instrumentarium Dental and SOREDEX. Specifically, Instrumentarium Dental continues the brands Orthopantomograph and intraoral systems FOCUS and SIGMA, formerly known as Instrumentarium Imaging or GE Healthcare products._NEWLINE_In September 2005, GE Healthcare and IDX Systems Corporation announced that they entered into a definitive, $1.2 billion merger agreement for GE to acquire IDX, a leading healthcare information technology (IT) provider. The acquisition was completed in January 2006. IDX was folded into GE Healthcare Integrated IT Solutions, which specializes in clinical information systems and healthcare revenue management._NEWLINE_On 4 February 2008, GE Healthcare announced that it had completed the acquisition of Whatman plc (LSE:WHM), a global supplier of filtration products and technologies at 270p per share in cash for each Whatman share, valuing Whatman at approximately £363 million (approximately $713 million.) In July 2008, Joseph Hogan announced his intent to leave his post as CEO of GE Healthcare to take the role of CEO at ABB. On July 17, 2008, GE Healthcare announced John Dineen had been chosen to replace outgoing CEO Joseph Hogan. Mr. Dineen had been head of GE's Transportation division since 2005. On March 24, 2010, GE Healthcare announced acquisition of MedPlexus. In late April, 2010, GE Healthcare announced it was investing €3 million in the Technology Research for Independent Living Centre (TRIL).

 _START_ARTICLE_ National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage _START_PARAGRAPH_ The National Association Opposed to Women Suffrage (NAOWS) was founded in the United States by women opposed to the suffrage movement in 1911. It was the most popular anti-suffrage organization in northeastern cities. NAOWS had influential local chapters in many states, including Texas and Virginia. _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ The National Association Opposed to Women Suffrage (NAOWS) was established by Josephine Jewell Dodge in New York City in 1911. Dodge had the first meeting at her house and women came from New York and surrounding states. Dodge was currently the president of the New York State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NYSAOWS). Dodge resigned from NYSAOWS to take over as president of NAOWS. Shortly after formation, state branches of NAOWS began to form. Headquarters in Washington, D.C. were opened in 1913, giving the organization a front in both New York and the U.S. Capital._NEWLINE_Like other anti-suffrage organizations, NAOWS published a newsletter as well as other publications, containing their opinions on the current political issues of the time. The newsletter of the association was called Woman's Protest (later renamed Woman Patriot in 1918). Dodge also toured the country, spreading anti-suffrage views to other states._NEWLINE_Members of the NAOWS typically belonged to wealthy families who feared suffrage would upset the status quo. In the South, the NAOWS gained support from many plantation owners who believed rights for women would lead to rights for minorities. Josephine Dodge, the founding president, was replaced in 1917, by Alice Hay Wadsworth, wife of U.S. Senator James W. Wadsworth, Jr. from New York. Upon amendment to the New York State Constitution granting women the right to vote, the focus of the NAOWS shifted from the state level to the federal level. The organization also began to see more men join NAOWS than before. The headquarters were moved solely to Washington D.C. and they merged with the Woman Patriot Publishing Company. The organization disbanded in 1920 as a result of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. _START_SECTION_ Texas Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage _START_PARAGRAPH_ In March 1916, the Texas Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (TAOWS) was created as a chapter of NAOWS in Houston with Pauline Wells as the president. The chapter in Texas also connected the increase in African Americans voting to women's suffrage and they stoked fears of "domination by the black race in the South." They also believed that women's suffrage was linked to "feminism, sex antagonism, socialism, anarchy and Mormonism." Like their parent organization, TAOWS had local chapters in major Texas cities. TAOWS fought against the Texas Equal Suffrage Association who were pushing for Texas women's right to vote in Texas primary elections in 1918. In April 1919, headquarters were moved to Fort Worth. In 1919, TAOWS successfully campaigned against a state measure for women's vote which was defeated by 25,000 votes in May. However, in June 1919, Texas passed a suffrage amendment, allowing women to vote and the TAOWS stopped fighting against women's suffrage. _START_SECTION_ Virginia Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage _START_PARAGRAPH_ A group, the Virginia Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (VAOWS) formed in Richmond in March 1912 and affiliated with NAOWS. Jane Rutherford served as the president of VAOWS. Local branches in different cities formed by 1913 and the organization distributed anti-suffrage literature. In 1915, VAOWS helped raise money for the Belgian Relief Fund during World War I. By May 1917, VAOWS had doubled in size and continued to grow through 1918. Around 8,000 women had signed up with the anti-suffrage cause in Richmond by 1919._NEWLINE_Like the Texas Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, VAOWS also suggested that race riots, the black vote and women's suffrage were connected. In a sponsored editorial published in The Richmond Times-Dispatch on September 2, 1919, VAOWS exclaimed, "RACE RIOTS WILL INCREASE IF THERE IS MORE POLITICS BETWEEN THE RACES AND IF WOMEN ARE MIXED UP IN POLITICS!" _START_SECTION_ Political views _START_PARAGRAPH_ One of NAOWS' publications included a pamphlet, Some Reasons Why We Oppose Votes for Women, which, as the title suggests, outlines some of the reasons why they are opposed to women suffrage. They believed it was irrelevant to the success of the country, as stated in their pamphlet:_NEWLINE_"Because the great advance of women in the last century— moral, intellectual and economic— has been made without the vote; which goes to prove that it is not needed for their further advancement along the same lines."_NEWLINE_The National Association Opposed to Women Suffrage opposed women's right to vote because they said that the majority of women did not want the right to vote, and because they believed that the men in their lives accurately represented the political will of women around the United States. NAOWS submitted pamphlets like these to the general public as well as directing them to government officials so that political figures would see that women opposed the then-unratified nineteenth amendment. They did this in order to counteract the rhetoric of the suffragettes of the time. According to the NAOWS and the state-based organizations that it inspired, voting would severely and negatively affect the true submissive and domestic state of the feminine. These organizations were championed by women who thought themselves the prime examples of true womanhood—quiet, dignified, and regal. They looked with disdain at the outward protests of suffragettes._NEWLINE_NAOWS wanted to appeal to conservative and traditional members of their community, including other women and religious figures. They positioned themselves as being in opposition of "the militant suffragette" and militant or "hysterical" tactics. NAOWS also believed that women's involvement in politics would interfere with their "civic duties for which they are peculiarly adapted." NAOWS believed that women were equal to men, but had different duties and "functions." _START_SECTION_ Quotes from Some Reasons Why We Oppose Votes For Women _START_PARAGRAPH_ "We believe that political equality will deprive us of special privileges hitherto accorded to us by law."_NEWLINE_"[We oppose suffrage] Because it means simply doubling the vote, and especially the undesirable and corrupt vote of our large cities." _NEWLINE_"[We oppose suffrage] Because our present duties fill up the whole measure of our time and ability, and are such as none but ourselves can perform."

 _START_ARTICLE_ Cloisters Cross _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Cloisters Cross, also referred to as the Bury St Edmunds Cross, is a complex 12th-century ivory Romanesque altar cross in The Cloisters, part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The cross is carved from walrus ivory. _START_SECTION_ Description _START_PARAGRAPH_ The carvings which cover both front and back sides include ninety-two intricately carved figures and ninety-eight inscriptions.  The figures, each of which is only about one-half inch tall, illustrate a number of Biblical scenes, and on the back a number of the Old Testament prophets with banderoles containing quotations from their books. There is debate over whether or not these inscriptions are chosen with an anti-Semitic intent. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's website currently says: "Prominent among the inscriptions are several strong invectives against Jews. Though it is impossible to know precisely who commissioned this piece and with what aims, the cross certainly offers some indication of the anti-Semitism prevalent in England at this time. By the end of the thirteenth century, Jews were expelled from the country". This theme was developed in a book by Thomas Hoving, the curator involved when the Metropolitan acquired the cross, and later Director. This was unkindly described in an academic review of Elizabeth C. Parker and Charles T. Little as "an autobiographical romance...written in Raymond Chandler style"._NEWLINE_Parker and Little disagree with Hoving and think that it is doubtful that the cross, a sophisticated theological object, was specifically designed for the purpose of either castigating or converting any member of the small Jewish population in England in the mid-twelfth century._NEWLINE_The sculptor is not known. Thomas Hoving, who managed the acquisition of the cross while he was associate curator at The Cloisters, concluded that it was carved by Master Hugo at Bury St Edmunds Abbey in Suffolk. However, beyond stylistic affinities there is no certain evidence to suggest that the cross was even made in England; although this is accepted by most scholars, other places of origin such as Germany have been proposed._NEWLINE_The history of the cross before it was acquired by Ante Topić Mimara (1898–1987) is unknown.  He sold it to the Metropolitan Museum in 1963.  The British Museum was also keen to buy the cross, but they eventually declined, because Topić Mimara steadfastly refused to provide proof that he had full title to sell the cross. Hoving reportedly sat up drinking coffee with Topić Mimara until after midnight on the night that the British Museum's option lapsed, and he purchased the cross immediately afterwards for £200,000.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Roberto Calasso _START_SECTION_ Biography _START_PARAGRAPH_ Calasso was born in Florence in 1941, into a family of the Tuscan upper class, well connected with some of the great Italian intellectuals of their time. His maternal grandfather Ernesto Codignola was a professor of philosophy at Florence University. Codignola created a new publishing house called La Nuova Italia, in Florence, as his friend Benedetto Croce had done in Bari with Laterza. Calasso's uncle, Tristano Codignola, was a partisan during World War II who after the war joined the political life of the new republic, and was for a while Minister of Education. His mother Melisenda – who gave up an academic career to raise her three children – was a scholar of German literature, working on Hölderlin’s translations of the Greek poet Pindar. Calasso's father Francesco was a law professor, first at Florence University and then in Rome, where he eventually became dean of his faculty. He was arrested  by the fascist militia after the assassination of Giovanni Gentile and sentenced to be killed in reprisal, but was saved by the intervention of both friends of Gentile, with whom the family had connections on the maternal side, and by the German consul Gerhard Wolf._NEWLINE_At 12 Calasso met and was greatly influenced by a professor at Padua University, Enzo Turolla, and they became lifelong friends. In 1954 the family moved to Rome, where Calasso developed a passion for cinema. His doctoral dissertation was Sir Thomas Browne's theory of hieroglyphs, which he completed under Mario Praz, while indulging himself with hashish._NEWLINE_Calasso has worked for the publishing firm of Adelphi Edizioni since its founding by Roberto Bazlen in 1962 and became its Chairman in 1999. His books have been translated into most European languages._NEWLINE_He is the author of an unnamed ongoing work reflecting on the culture of modernity which began with The Ruin of Kasch in 1983, a book admired by Italo Calvino. Dedicated to the French statesman Talleyrand, it was followed in 1988 by The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, in which the tale of Cadmus and his wife Harmonia becomes a pretext for re-telling the great tales of Greek mythology and reflecting on the reception of Greek culture for a contemporary readership. Another world civilization is surveyed in Ka (1996, where the subject of the re-telling is Hindu mythology). K restricts the focus to a single author, Franz Kafka; this trend continues with Il rosa Tiepolo, inspired by an adjective used by Proust to describe a shade of pink used by Tiepolo in his paintings. With La folie Baudelaire, Calasso once more broadens his scope to fresco a whole civilisation, that of Paris in the latter half of the 19th century, reconsidering the lives and works of the post-romantic generation of writers and artists from Baudelaire to Valéry. In his most recent work, Ardore (2010), the author returns to India for an exhaustive analysis of the theory and practice of Vedic sacrifice and its significance for post-modern epistemology._NEWLINE_His more narrowly focused essays relating to European modernity are collected in I quarantanove gradini (The Forty-nine Steps), addressed to Pierre Klossowski and his wife; Literature and the gods (2002) (based on his Weidenfeld Lectures at Oxford, on the decline and return of pagan imagery in the art of the west), and La follia che viene dalle ninfe (The Madness that Comes from the Nymphs), a collection of related essays ranging from Plato's Phaedrus to Nabokov's Lolita._NEWLINE_Along with his status as a major analyst specifically of the works of Kafka, Calasso has, more broadly, been active in many essays in retrieving and re-invigorating the notion of a Central European literary culture. He also serves as the president of the International Alexander Lernet-Holenia Society, which promotes the publication, translation and study of this multi-genre Austrian writer and his focus on the identity crisis of his characters at odds with postimperial Austria and Central Europe. _START_SECTION_ Reception _START_PARAGRAPH_ Terri Windling selected the English translation of The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony as one of the best fantasy books of 1994, describing it as "a complex and intellectually dazzling novel using ancient Greek mythology to explore the origins of Western thought."

Watchmen, lock tenders, and bridge workers in the state department of public works are also denied one day of rest in seven._NEWLINE__NEWLINE_It would be a simple matter to amend that section of the N.Y. labor law so as to give all workers in New York this protection. At the request of the City Affairs Committee such an amendment was introduced at the 1932 session of the Legislature.  The bill was never reported out of committee or given a public hearing. Communications were sent to the Governor, acquainting him with the facts and requesting his support, but he did not make any effort to compel action from he legislature.

It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, has been responsible for the production of every VC. _START_SECTION_ Appearance _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Victoria Cross for New Zealand is identical to the original design. The decoration is a cross pattée, 41 millimetres (1.6 in) high, 36 millimetres (1.4 in) wide, bearing a crown surmounted by a lion, and the inscription FOR VALOUR. This was originally to have been FOR BRAVERY, until it was changed on the recommendation of Queen Victoria, who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the VC were brave in battle. The decoration, suspension bar and link weigh about 27 grams (0.87 troy ounces)._NEWLINE_The cross is suspended by a ring from a seriffed "V" to a bar ornamented with laurel leaves, through which the ribbon passes.  The reverse of the suspension bar is engraved with the recipient's name, rank, number and unit. On the reverse of the medal is a circular panel on which the date of the act for which it was awarded is engraved in the centre. The ribbon is crimson, 38 millimetres (1.5 inches) wide. Although the warrants state the colour as being red it is described by most commentators as being crimson or "wine-red".

It runs north for about 200 feet, then veers to the north-northeast and runs parallel with the railroad track about 100 feet to the east. Upon reaching Mill Street, the road veers back to the north and proceeds to its northern terminus at State Road 57 at the north edge of town. It is concurrent with Main Street over its entire length.
 _START_ARTICLE_ George Geldorp _START_PARAGRAPH_ George Geldorp, Georg Geldorp or Jorge Geldorp (1580/1595, Cologne – 4 November 1665, London) was a Flemish painter who was mainly active in England where he was known for his portraits and history paintings. He was also active as an art dealer and impresario. _START_SECTION_ Life _START_PARAGRAPH_ Geldorp was the son of the Flemish portrait painter Gortzius Geldorp who lived and worked in Cologne. Geldorp first trained and worked as a painter in Cologne before being admitted as a Master in the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp in 1610. Two years later his first wife Margriet Parmentiers died in Antwerp._NEWLINE_In 1623, Geldorp moved to London where he painted a number of portraits in the Anglo-Netherlandish style, notably of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury and his wife Catherine in 1626 (Hatfield House, Hertfordshire) and of Sir Arthur Ingram in late 1638/early 1639._NEWLINE_He was involved in organizing commissions in England for Flemish and Dutch artists including Rubens, Anthony van Dyck and Peter Lely.  Upon the Restoration, he assisted with the reconstitution of the art collection and possessions of the English Royal family and was rewarded for his services with the post of picture mender and cleaner to the King._NEWLINE_He was the teacher of Isaac Sailmaker. _START_SECTION_ Work _START_PARAGRAPH_ George Geldorp was a portrait specialist.  His portraits are regarded as less accomplished and more stiffly articulated than those of contemporary painters active in London such as Daniel Mijtens.  The surfaces of his paintings are decorative. The background of the Portrait of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Salisbury contains an historically important view of Hatfield House with sportsmen in the foreground._NEWLINE_Geldorp was also active as a collaborator and copyist of Anthony van Dyck and later Peter Lely._NEWLINE_The Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken reported that Geldorp was known to the artist biographer Joachim von Sandrart.  Von Sandrart had written that Geldorp was not a very accomplished draughtsman and had the habit of tracing other's sketches, and then pricking holes in these sketches, and sponging this onto the canvas as a guide to paint his subjects. Houbraken disapproved of this practise and wrote that he preferred to write about painters who were good draughtsmen.
 _START_ARTICLE_ A381 road _START_SECTION_ Route _START_PARAGRAPH_ The A381 starts in Teignmouth from a junction with the A379 at Shaldon Bridge, following the Teign Estuary to Kingsteignton, where it overlaps the A380 to cross the River Teign.  At the Penn Inn Roundabout it then continues west on a short dual carriageway into central Newton Abbot and southwest to Totnes. Here it overlaps the A385 to cross the River Dart and the main London-Penzance railway line._NEWLINE_From a junction on the west of Totnes it rises southwards into the South Hams. This section of the road is an important link to the national road network for the town of Dartmouth (served by the A3122) as the alternative A379 via Torbay is reliant upon the Dartmouth Higher Ferry with its associated fares and peak-time queues. As the road approaches Kingsbridge it enters the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and skirts around the edge of the town, overlapping for a short distance with the A379 road before finally turning south to Salcombe. An identically-numbered spur from this road turns back eastward to Kingsbridge. _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ The constant pressure of traffic through the narrow streets of Totnes town centre prompted the construction of the Western Bypass around the edge of the town, together with a second crossing of the River Dart at Brutus Bridge in 1982. The tight-knit nature of the town centre's development, quickly thinning to countryside, meant that relatively few buildings needed demolition to facilitate construction of the new road. _NEWLINE_In 1991 and 2006 the route through and around Kingsbridge was redrawn twice, when the section northwest of Kingsbridge was downgraded to B-road status leaving a gap in the route, and subsequently diverted to the former route of the B3197 around the west side of the town leaving the original section through West Alvington as a spur of the new road. _NEWLINE_As a rural main road, the A381 has been the scene of multiple accidents. During 2008-2010 there were three fatal accidents on the section from Totnes to Halwell, prompting Devon County Council to implement a Casualty Severity Reduction Scheme, improving road markings and signage. _NEWLINE_On Sunday 20 May 2012 a 0.7-mile (1.1 km) section of the road through Totnes was part of the Olympic Torch procession for the London 2012 Olympics.
 _START_ARTICLE_ United States House Select Committee on Alleged Abstraction of Books from the Library of the House _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Committee on Alleged Abstraction of Books from the Library of the House was a select committee of the United States House of Representatives that existed from February 14–28, 1861._NEWLINE_The committee was charged with investigating rumors that several members of the House of Representatives from several states that had seceded from the United States had taken books from the House Library for personal use, or, alternatively, to help start a congressional library for the Confederate States of America. The allegations were first made public by The New York Times in an article published February 13, 1861, that accused Members of Congress of taking "some of the most valuable volumes in the collection._NEWLINE_The select committee's investigation determined those rumors to be in error, finding that the supposed missing books had instead not been properly credited back to the representatives' accounts after being returned.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Shazam (application) _START_SECTION_ Overview _START_PARAGRAPH_ Shazam identifies songs based on an audio fingerprint based on a time-frequency graph called a spectrogram. It uses a smartphone or computer's built-in microphone to gather a brief sample of audio being played. Shazam stores a catalogue of audio fingerprints in a database. The user tags a song for 10 seconds and the application creates an audio fingerprint. Shazam works by analyzing the captured sound and seeking a match based on an acoustic fingerprint in a database of millions of songs. If it finds a match, it sends information such as the artist, song title, and album back to the user. Some implementations of Shazam incorporate relevant links to services such as iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, or Groove Music._NEWLINE_Shazam can identify music being played from any source, provided that the background noise level is not high enough to prevent an acoustic fingerprint being taken, and that the song is present in the software's database._NEWLINE_As well as the free app, the company has released a paid app called Shazam Encore. In September 2012, the service was expanded to enable TV users in the US to identify featured music, access cast information, and get links to show information online, as well as added social networking capabilities._NEWLINE_Shazam redesigned their app in 2014,  and added additional features. _START_SECTION_ Compatible devices _START_PARAGRAPH_ Shazam runs on Android, iOS (including Apple Watch), BlackBerry OS, and Windows Phone systems. Shazam is also available for Mac, as a desktop application that when enabled, runs in the background and automatically recognises any song played on or near the computer.  Apple's launch of iOS 8 in September 2014 came with the integration of Shazam into Apple's Siri function. _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ The company was founded in 1999 by Barton and Inghelbrecht, who were students at University of California, Berkeley and Mukherjee, who worked at a London-based internet consulting firm called Viant. In need of a digital signal processing specialist, the founding team then hired Wang, who had received his PhD from Stanford University. It first made a profit in 2016, 17 years after launch. _START_SECTION_ 2002–2006: Early days of the service _START_PARAGRAPH_ Initially, in 2002, the service was launched only in the UK and was known as "2580", as the number was the shortcode that customers dialled from their mobile phone to get music recognised. The phone would automatically hang up after 30 seconds. A result was then sent to the user in the form of a text message containing the song title and artist name. At a later date, the service also began to add hyperlinks in the text message to allow the user to download the song online._NEWLINE_Shazam launched in the US on the AT&T Wireless network in 2004 in a joint offering with Musicphone, a now defunct San Francisco-based company. The service was free at launch with AT&T saying that it would charge $0.99 for each use in future._NEWLINE_In 2006, users were charged £0.60 per call or had unlimited use for £4.50 a month, as well as an online service to keep track of all tags. _START_SECTION_ 2006–2017: Smartphone app and expansion _START_PARAGRAPH_ Shazam for iPhone debuted on 10 July 2008, with the launch of Apple's App Store.

 _START_ARTICLE_ International scale of river difficulty _START_SECTION_ Caution in application _START_PARAGRAPH_ Classifications can vary enormously, depending on the skill level and experience of the paddlers who rated the river.  For example, at the 1999 International Conference on Outdoor Recreation and Education, an author of a paddling guide pointed out that there is too much variation in what is covered by the Class I designation, and proposed making further distinctions within the Class I flat water designations and Class I+ moving water designations, with the goal of providing better information for canoeists, instructors leading trips, and families with young children._NEWLINE_The grade of a river or rapid is likely to change along with the level of the water. High water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous, although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or washed out. At spate/flood stage, even rapids which are usually easy can contain lethal and unpredictable hazards. Conversely, some rapids may be easier with lower water levels when dangerous hydraulics become easier to manage. Some rivers with high volumes of fast moving water may require little maneuvering, but will pose serious risk of injury or death in the event of a capsize.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Zambian kwacha _START_SECTION_ Etymology _START_PARAGRAPH_ The name kwacha derives from the Nyanja, Bemba, and Tonga language word for "dawn", alluding to the Zambian nationalist slogan of a "new dawn of freedom". The name ngwee translates as "bright" in the Nyanja language. _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ Prior to independence, the Rhodesia and Nyasaland pound was the legal tender of the short-lived British protectorate of Northern Rhodesia. Banknotes of 10 shillings, 1, 5, and 10 pounds issued by the Central Africa Currency Board were in circulation, together with coins of ½, 1, 3, 6 pence, and 1, 2, 2½, and 5 shillings. After independence, the Bank of Zambia issued the first Zambian currency, the Zambian pound, in 1964. The issued paper bills and coins were of similar denominations as these used before independence, except for the 10 pounds note, which was never issued by the Bank of Zambia. A new design to depict the newly independent country's history and struggle was adopted. The two currencies - the Rhodesia and Nyasaland pound and the Zambian pound, were allowed to circulate in parallel until December 15, 1965, when the South Rhodesian pound bills and coins were withdrawn from circulation, except for the 3 pence coin which was allowed to circulate alongside its Zambian alternative for a brief period._NEWLINE_On July 1, 1966, the parliament approved the arrangements of the decimal currency system (Act 40 of 1966). The government voted in favor of decimalisation, and changing the main currency unit to Kwacha, with one kwacha being equal to 100 ngwee. The exchange rate was set to one kwacha equivalent to ten Zambian shillings, or one half of a Zambian pound. Thus, by January 16, 1968, all Zambian pound bills and coins were removed from circulation and replaced by the new kwacha bills, and ngwee coins. The Zambian pound bills of 10 shillings, 1, and 5 pounds were changed into 1, 2 and 10 kwacha respectively, a bill of 50 ngwee was issued to replace the old 5 shillings coin, alongside a new bill of 20 kwacha. Ngwee coins with the denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 ngwee replacing the existing 1, 3, 6 pence, 1, and 2 shillings coins respectively. The Zambian pound notes, and coins ceased to be a legal tender on January 31, 1974._NEWLINE_At the very beginning, the kwacha was pegged to the pound at a fixed rate of 1.7094 kwacha per 1 pound. Yet, after the devaluation of the dollar on August 15, 1971, Zambia broke all its currency's ties to the British monetary unit, and pegged the kwacha to the American monetary unit. These reforms resulted in a reduction of the kwacha's gold standard by 7.8%. A few months later, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber, announced the demise of the Sterling area, and flotation of the sterling pound, causing Zambia to renounce the monetary privileges once enjoyed as a member state._NEWLINE_Throughout the years, the Zambian currency suffered high rates of inflation forcing the Bank of Zambia to introduce high value denominations in 2003, including 20,000 and 50,000 kwacha bills to facilitate transactions. In 2013, a new, redenominated kwacha was introduced. _START_SECTION_ Banknotes _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Zambian kwacha was first issued in 1968 to replace the Zambian pound. The design of the kwacha bill changed as time went on, also, different bills were either introduced in or withdrawn from circulation. Seven emissions of the first kwacha are known to exist, while only one emission of the second kwacha was introduced in circulation on January 1, 2013, and still existing since then without any changes in design or security features. Each emission share similar general features in design throughout all the banknotes, with slight changes concerning the colors and the activity based theme on the reverse of the banknotes. _START_SECTION_ New Kwacha (2012 series) _START_PARAGRAPH_ On January 23, 2012, the Bank of Zambia proposed certain measures in regards of the redenomination of the Zambian kwacha. Such recommendations were initially approved by the government, being one of the measures required to address costs associated with the continuous devaluation of the national currency, due to depreciation throughout time, as a direct result of several years of high inflation rates that characterized the national economy during the late decades of the 20th century, and the early years of the 21st century. The recommendations were assented to the parliament on November 3, 2012. Later, The Re-Domination of Currency Act (Act 8 of 2012) was enacted on December 3, 2012._NEWLINE_The old currency unit was divided by 1000, hence, removing three zeros from the preexisting K50,000, K20,000, K10,000, K5,000, and K1,000. The lower denominations of K500, K100, and K50 were also divided by 1000 and were changed into the 1 Kwacha, 50, 10, and 5 Ngwee coins respectively. On the other hand, the preexisting K20 banknote was removed from circulation due to its extremely low purchasing power._NEWLINE_The Bank of Zambia announced January 1, 2013 as the changeover date. On the same day, the new redenominated currency became the legal tender of Zambia. The old and new currencies were allowed to circulate side-by-side for a transition period of six months, until 30 June 2013. During this period, the old currency was denoted by 'K', whilst the new one was denoted by 'KR'. After the six-month period, the 'KR' symbol was dropped, and the new currency was referred to by the 'K' symbol._NEWLINE_By June 26, 2013, the Bank of Zambia managed to withdraw 3.7 trillion Kwacha in old banknotes, accumulating to about 95.3% of the circulating banknotes. Although the old currency ceased to be legal tender four days later, the Bank of Zambia Deputy Governor, announced that residents who were still holding to the old currency, especially those living in rural areas, could still be able to exchange the old currency for the new one through commercial banks, and other designated agents.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Transportin 1 _START_SECTION_ Function _START_PARAGRAPH_ This protein is a karyopherin which interacts with nuclear localization sequence to target nuclear proteins to the nucleus. The classical karyopherin receptor complex, such as the complex that uses Importin-β1 (encoded by gene KPNB1), is a heterodimer of an alpha subunit which recognizes the nuclear localization signal and a beta subunit which docks the complex at nucleoporins. However, Transportin-1 can directly bind to the cargo proteins and may not need importin alpha subunit to do it._NEWLINE_Transportin-1 is thought to use the same principal mechanism to carry out nuclear transport as other Importins. It mediates docking to the nuclear pore complex through binding to nucleoporin and is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring mechanism. Then, in the nucleus Ran binds to Transportin-1, it dissociates from cargo, and Transportin-1 is re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran. Then Transportin-1 is free to bind new cargo._NEWLINE_In addition, Transportin-1 is implicated in helping protein transport into primary cilium. The function of Transportin-1 in this case is thought to be similar to carrying proteins into the nucleus through a nuclear pore. Transportin-1 binds cargo and then is helping this cargo to pass through a pore at the base of the cilium. Ran and nucleoporins are also implicated in this mechanism._NEWLINE_Alternate splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding different proteins. _START_SECTION_ Targets _START_PARAGRAPH_ Transportin 1 (TRN1) is part of the non-classical nuclear import pathway. In conjunction with the RanGTP hydrolysis cascade TRN1 acts to import a selection of proteins into the nucleus of cells. These targets typically contain a PY-motif otherwise known as a M9 nuclear localisation signal. Well described examples include hnRNP A1._NEWLINE_The type of cargo proteins that Transportin 1 can carry into the nucleus include RNA-binding proteins (such as hnRNP A1 and hnRNP F) and also ribosomal proteins. _START_SECTION_ Clinical Significance _START_PARAGRAPH_ TRN1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of two neurodegenerative diseases namely Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Embedded feminism _START_PARAGRAPH_ Embedded feminism is the attempt of state authorities to legitimize an intervention in a conflict by co-opting feminist discourses and instrumentalizing feminist activists and groups for their own agenda. This term was introduced in the analysis of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but can also be applied to several historical examples where women's rights were used as justification and legitimization of Western interventionism. _START_SECTION_ Concept _START_PARAGRAPH_ Originally, the Canadian gender researcher Krista Hunt developed the conceptual framework of embedded feminism to describe the gendered nature of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the practice of the US government to justify the War on Terror in the eyes of the public._NEWLINE_Hunt defines the concept as the "incorporation of feminist discourse and feminist activists into political projects that claim to serve the interests of women, but ultimately subordinate and/or subvert that goal"._NEWLINE_Hunt coined the term embedded feminism referring to the "embedded journalism" or "embedded media" approach of the US Department of Defense which became prominent in the media coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The US government attached journalists, photographers, and camera people to military units and granted them unprecedented access to the battle frontline. Although "embedded journalism" allowed the public to get an exclusive look at the situation in Iraq, this practice was regarded as problematic, as it could undermine the independent reporting and promote the preferences of the government._NEWLINE_The "far-reaching process of appropriating and subverting feminism through appeals to women's rights" that is embedded feminism is different from simple co-optation practices by state authorities in so far as it goes beyond the absorption "of the meanings of the original concepts to fit into the prevailing political priorities". _START_SECTION_ Historical examples _START_PARAGRAPH_ Krista Hunt argues that appeals to women's liberation have been embedded in political projects for centuries to mobilize feminists and their discourses._NEWLINE_A large body of feminist literature has analyzed the gender-related dimensions of (post-) colonial projects where feminists from the Global North were convinced to get involved in order to "save" other oppressed women. Such rescue narratives generally presuppose a homogeneity of women as an oppressed group, as showed in the work of Chandra Mohanty, and put into play the orientalized nature of the seemingly dangerous "brown man". Thus, feminism which was incorporated in the modernization and civilization projects of imperial countries is argued to have helped strengthening colonialism and patriarchy instead of promoting women's rights._NEWLINE_Feminists also claim that feminist activists and their discourses have been instrumentalized for nationalist projects. During the Nasser era in Egypt for example, feminists are said to have played a major role in helping create a sense of cohesion and bonding and therefore directly contributed to the emergence of a national identity during and after the struggle for independence. Nevertheless, women remained mostly absent from the public sphere of politics once the project succeed. _START_SECTION_ The War on Terror _START_PARAGRAPH_ The history of the war on terrorism throughout the IR realm consistently showcased a male-stream discipline and a hyper-masculine war hero narrative. In other words, the story is narrated by these men, who hold high positions of power and are fixated to exemplify their heroic qualities to shield women from harm and collide with the world’s difficulties. For example, according to the former US President, George W. Bush, the central goal of the terrorists is the brutal oppression of women…that is the reason this great nation, with our friends and allies, will not rest until we bring them all to justice . This rallying cry by the Bush administration is exactly the narrative that is at question. The time-honored tradition of the good guys defeating the bad guys and protecting racialized women serves to reinforce patriotism and justify violence both abroad and at home. However, how does one exemplify “the bad guys”?  By using a gendered lens and looking at the war of terror through a gendered perspective, a simple rallying cry has far more complexities. For instance, there is a power dynamic at play here involving two opposing parties. There is the Western men and women who are deemed to be the saviors. Then there are the Afghan women who needs saving. What does this do? This creates a subtle social construct that the war on terror has created different kinds of men and women based on race, religion and nationality . Having said that, a gendered lens does ignore specific factors. It ignores the power dynamic of liberated white western women against their oppressed Afghan women. Basically, in a war, your race and nationality come heavily into play when it comes to who is deemed to be more liberated.  It ignores the historical colonial justification for invasion by proclaiming racialized men are harmful to racialized women. Feminists analyzed Bush’s rallying cry and found similarities to the white men knowing what’s right and saving the racialized women because of perceptions about the racialized men. It ignores the reinforced resistance to women’s rights, whereas men see it as Western imposition. In a war situation, when a Western country tries to help an oppressed nation, it is seen as western imposition because it is as if “the west knows best”, without even being apart or living in an oppressed nation and gives the perception that anything the West does (even empowering women) is treated as imposition.  It ignores the obscurity of the reality that white Western women are still being oppressed by the same powers that are trying to liberate Afghan women. Finally, it ignores the overarching point of all these factors which is the creation of a divide and conquer situation of women while also initiating solidarity of all women . In other words, what all these factors mean is the examination of race, class, nationality, religion and sexuality, we notice factors that were passive such as progressing onward with political agendas that are traditional, old testament and problematic while also trying to play the good guy by silencing other related key issues. In conclusion, Gender has become a topic that is heavily scrutinized but also heavily appreciated and even in the most traditional of scenarios, a gender lens/perspective is very much needed to tackle the real issue of IR._NEWLINE_In 2001, the Bush administration began expressing their concerns for the situation of women under the Taliban regime. According to Hunt, it invoked the struggle for women's rights and women's liberation as a rational to justify the invasion of Afghanistan. This increased gender awareness can be interpreted as part of a framing strategy which conflated the War on Terror with the fight for women's rights as a proxy for universal human rights. In the eyes of many feminists, the rescue of oppressed women from the Taliban became the powerful normative legitimation of the invasion which obtained broad public approval. More importantly, this strategy could align itself with feminist groups, that are traditionally pacifist, and could win their approval, thereby removing a critical opposition. The doubts in the government's commitment to further women's rights through war arose due to its lack of interest before 9/11. It was only after the terror attacks, that politicians in the US and in Europe began broadly supporting women's liberation from the Taliban._NEWLINE_Despite its usual non-violent stance, the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF) supporter the policies of the Bush administration and is therefore regarded as one of the most vocal feminist supporters embedded in the War on Terror. Although the FMF saw the government's increased gender awareness as a success of their ‘Stop Gender Apartheid’ campaign, their involvement in Bush's political project was strongly criticized by other NGOs and the critical public because their role was considered to be legitimizing._NEWLINE_Hunt sees embedded feminism as a concept that was used to advance the engendered war story of the Bush administration that the invasion of Afghanistan could liberate Afghan women. It has further created a division between feminist groups that supported the war and those groups that refused to get involved in the usurpation of feminism for war. A division also emerged between "Western" feminists who strived to save the "Other" women from an orientalised enemy and Afghan feminists who criticized the notion that war could liberate them. _START_SECTION_ Hegemonic Western feminism and post-colonial critique _START_PARAGRAPH_ Hunt notes that there is a striking similarity between the logic of embedded feminism in colonialist projects and the War on Terror. Both are inherently Eurocentric and present the West as culturally and normatively superior to the "unmodern" Eastern societies. This rationale would give the West a prerogative to intervene and rescue the "monolithic group" of Other women who have no agency on their own. Spivak's famous post-colonial critique of the relationship between the colonizers and the colonized subjects in "Can the Subaltern speak?" condenses this relationship to the strategy of "white men saving brown women from brown men". This analysis can also be applied to the seemingly neo-imperialist strategy that the US government was pursuing by framing Taliban men in Afghanistan as a danger to women who were presented as victims in need of help from the West._NEWLINE_Characteristic for Western hegemonic feminism was the disregard of Western actors for the opinions of Afghan women's groups who argued that a war would certainly have a negative impact on women and fuel fundamentalist sentiments. In the aftermath, Bush's agenda was in fact interpreted as an attack on Islamic values and resulted in a backlash from the conservative forces.Hegemonic feminism also tends to reproduce binary gender roles, especially in the visual representation of women and children as victims of war or oppression in the media. Cynthia Enloe has called this conflation of women and children as victimized subjects "womenandchildren", a single trope that is being invoked in patriarchic narratives to support state security interests. _START_SECTION_ Contextualisation _START_PARAGRAPH_ The unique nature of embedded feminism as a state strategy is not just the argumentation based on the representation of women and children as victims but the conjunction of this discourse with the struggle for women's rights. _NEWLINE_Hunt's concept has made an impact on gender-related conflict research and has been applied to the wars in Iraq, Kosovo and Afghanistan. Embedded feminism can also be used in other contexts such as neo-liberal globalization and can be applied to several other policy fields where pseudo-feminist arguments and feminist groups are misused to legitimize a state-led action or to construct an alternative story.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Ridgeway Mine _START_SECTION_ Extraction _START_PARAGRAPH_ Ore was blasted out of the mine pits and hauled in 85-ton trucks to ore storage heaps at the surface of the mine. Each ore truckload had only around 1.5 to 3 ounces of extractable gold in it, and for every ore truckload there was a truckload of waste rock. Recovering the ore's microscopic gold deposits was a multi-step process. First, the ore was milled to 200 mesh and soaked in a mixture of sodium cyanide, lime and water in one of ten giant tanks for twenty-seven days to dissolve the gold in the ore. Next, the solution was sent through a carbon in leach process where activated charcoal is used to absorb the gold from the solution.  The gold on the carbon granules was dissolved into a second solution as it was sent through a stripping column under high pressure. This solution is used in an electrowinning process that deposits the gold onto steel wool cathodes. The gold-plated steel wool undergoes electrorefining and its gold is deposited onto stainless steel plates. Finally, the gold is scraped off of these stainless steel plates, fed into a gold crucible and melted into  doré bars. _START_SECTION_ Geology _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Carolina Slate Belt (CSB) originated in the Proterozoic or Cambrian age with a volcanic arc terrane, a chain of volcanoes that form on the edge of one continental plate when it has another continental plate subducted under it. Later, as part of the Taconic orogeny these volcanoes were metamorphosed to greenschist. Finally, the Acadian orogeny and Alleghanian orogeny sheared the rocks and created intrusive granite from the intrusions of magma into cracks in the rock._NEWLINE_The mine is located in an east-west trend of the CSB which otherwise follows in a northeastern trend. It is also on the boundary between an older igneous terrane called the Sawney's Creek volcanics and a newer Bear Creek turbidite (sedimentary rock made from slides of liquefied sediments) terrane. The North Pit's primary gold ore is a chert made from either fine-grained sediment or a volcanic tuff and the South Pit's primary gold ore is finely laminated sediments from underwater flows of felsic (rich in feldspar and quartz) ash from a volcano. There is some debate on the processes that created the ore but there is consensus that exhalative sediments formed when hot water from a deep geothermal vent cooled and precipitated gold onto the ocean floor and these gold-bearing sediments were further concentrated when they were dissolved and precipitated again by an epithermal process (cooler geothermal vents closer to the surface). _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ Gold was first found in the Carolina Slate Belt in 1827 at the Haile mine in nearby Lancaster County. Placer mining, hydraulic mining and later use of the Newbery-Vautin chlorination process kept South Carolina mines in operation but by the year 1900 mining became unprofitable and had mostly stopped. In the 1960s interest in mining the Ridgeway area increased after John Chapman found gold while panning in nearby creeks. Amselco Minerals, a company later merged with Kennecott Minerals, began investigating Ridgeway after geologist Irving T. Kiff noticed similarities between Ridgeway's slate outcrops and outcrops at the Haile mine. Kennecott Minerals began buying land for the Ridgeway mine in 1980 and began mining in 1988. _START_SECTION_ Accidents _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Ridgeway mine was a relatively safe operation, only killing three employees in eleven years of operation._NEWLINE_On August 18, 1988 James F. Wise, while working as a spotter for a pan scraper, was crushed to death when it backed over him. Roosevelt Williams, the scraper driver, was also injured and was sent to the hospital for treatment. The Caterpillar model 623 scraper that Williams was driving that day has limited visibility for the driver and no right side rear view mirror, blocking the driver from seeing anything within 30 feet of the right side of the scraper. Williams was instructed in weekly safety meetings to keep spotters in his eyesight while driving the vehicle and to not start moving the vehicle until the spotter is located. On the day of the accident Williams did not locate the spotter before moving and only watched the left side of the vehicle while backing it out. Wise was crushed under the right tires of the scraper. Williams did not notice that his spotter was missing until he had backed up for around 100 feet and saw Wise lying around 98 feet in front of him. _NEWLINE_On April 21, 1993 Johnny Ray fell to his death after he was pushed off the top of the mine into the pit by a forklift. Steven Crapps, the forklift driver, was attempting to park the forklift by putting it in neutral and applying the parking brake. However, he also turned off the forklift's engine which provides power to the hydraulic brake system pumps. The braking system has a backup accumulator system that allows the brakes to function even when the engine is turned off, however later tests of the forklift showed that the accumulator was broken. When the brakes failed the forklift rolled down a 5%-6% grade slope towards the edge of the mine pit. Ray was between the forks of the forklift and was pushed by it for around 15 feet as it rolled towards the mine pit. A small berm at the edge of the pit prevented the forklift from rolling over the edge but Ray was pushed into the pit, suffered a drop of around 85 feet, was evacuated by helicopter to a local hospital and later died._NEWLINE_On February 2, 1997 Joseph Sumpter was fatally crushed by a runaway haulage truck. The truck, assigned to Sumpter for the day's work, had a bad battery and starter and had to be jump started by another vehicle. It also had a completely inoperable parking brake. His co-worker, Robert Stover, pulled his truck in front of Sumpter's truck to jump start it and Sumpter climbed across the engine decks of both trucks to connect jumper cables. Sumpter's truck was immobilized with a wooden chock but when Stover parked facing Sumpter's truck he pushed Sumpter's truck backward about two feet behind the chock. The jump start was successful and Stover backed his truck away, allowing Sumpter's truck to roll forward, bypass the chock and continue rolling down a 3% grade hill. Sumpter held on to the engine deck while the truck rolled for around 57 feet, but near the end of the ride Sumpter fell off and was run over by the front wheel of the truck. Sumpter was pronounced dead at the scene._NEWLINE_On the weekend of December 3, 1988, soon after the mine began chemically processing the mined ore, a flock of around 400 sea gulls landed in and around the tailings pond and 65 of the seagulls died. Ridgeway Mining had installed scare cannons to prevent birds from landing in the cyanide pond but in this case it was ineffective. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources levied a $6,500 fine against Ridgeway Mining for killing the birds. _START_SECTION_ Closure _START_PARAGRAPH_ Mining stopped in the South Pit mine in September 1996 and the North Pit shut down in November 1999. Ore processing finished on December 3, 1999. The Confederate States Mint struck commemorative gold, silver and bronze coins with metal from the mine and sold them to the general public. The coins were marketed as wholly South Carolina gold and featured a local building used by the Confederate army during the American Civil War. The Ridgeway Mining Company also commissioned the Confederate States Mint to mint a coin out of the mine's gold and silver which it gave to the mine employees as gifts. _START_SECTION_ Reclamation _START_PARAGRAPH_ The mine tailings are a pyrite-bearing rock which, when exposed to water and oxygen, causes acid rock drainage and environmental damage. Kennecott Ridgeway designed an impoundment for the tailings that seals them off from rainwater runoff and the atmosphere. If fresh water was allowed to run through the tailings it would constantly dissolve and oxidize the rock's sulfides so the tailings are instead kept in stagnant water that has already had a chance to fully saturate with sulfides. The impoundment was created by saturating the tailings with water, mining nearby inert saprolites and clay, sending the saprolites and clay through the ore mills and pouring them over the tailing pile to create a cone over the mine tailings._NEWLINE_The Ridgeway mine recovery has been an ecological success with minimal seepage of acid water into the environment, a stark contrast to the nearby Barite Hill and Brewer gold mines that were both declared Superfund sites after being abandoned by their owners. _START_SECTION_ South Pit Lake _START_PARAGRAPH_ Both mine pits are expected to fill with water by 2020 and public access is planned for the reclaimed South Pit Lake. Mine management hopes to create a meromictic lake, a self-regulated lake with distinct layers of water that do not mix, to minimize oxidation of sulfides and prevent toxic metals from circulating in the environment.  A comprehensive study of the South Pit Lake's limnology was conducted from 2000 to 2004, measuring its physical, chemical and biological properties. Wind is typically the most important contributing factor to mixing in a lake and the South Pit Lake was found to have a poor alignment with the prevailing direction of wind in the area. To counteract the mixing forces of wind the lake has other properties that promote water layer stability and stratification. Its relative depth, a ratio of the lake's surface area to its depth, is around 10%, typical of other meromictic lakes. There are several underwater features that dissipate wave energy and reduce the strength of wind-powered seiches in the lake.  Finally, bacteria in the lake contributed to a pycnocline by precipitating carbon, gypsum and metals out of the upper layer, lowering the density of the upper layer, increasing the density of the lower layer and promoting lake stability. The lake successfully achieved meromixis in the winter of 2001 and maintained it until the end of the study in 2004. _START_SECTION_ Future mining _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Strongbow Exploration company announced that it was investigating a possible new strike of gold within three miles of Rio Tinto's Ridgeway mine in 2011. After releasing several press releases announcing positive test results from drilling samples and the signing of property purchase option agreements with landowners there has been no further communication on their Ridgeway exploration since December 2012.

As a university graduate and a tonsured monk with a chosen name Vasilije, he became a secretary to the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Skopje. In this influential post, he had numerous contacts with his people and consulates of Serbia, Russia, and France. Among the clergy, he was known as Vasilije (Radenković) and among the laity simply Bogdan Radenković._NEWLINE_Bogdan Radenković was a member of the Serbian Committee of Skopje and the main organizer of the Serbian Chetnik action in the Ottoman Empire. He was an intermediary between the Serbian consulate and the Chetnik organization and their supporters. During 1905 the Turkish authorities caught a farmer who after being tortured revealed that Radenković was the president of the Serbian Committee in Skopje. At the Skopje trial, the farmer recanted citing that his testimony was extracted by force and Radenković was ultimately acquitted. Radenković was a friend of Milan Rakić, then Serbia's vice-consul in Skopje, with whom he conferred confidential operational plans of the Chetnik organization. Milan Rakić at the time began writing a poem called "On Gazimestan" that became popular even before the Balkan War of 1912. _START_SECTION_ Founding of the Serb Democratic League _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Serb Democratic League in the Ottoman Empire (Serbian: Српска демократска лига у Отоманској царевини) was an Ottoman Serb political organisation established on August 13, 1908, at the First Serb Conference (August 10–13), immediately after the Young Turk Revolution. Some 26 most distinguished Serbs in the Ottoman Empire attended and Bogdan Radenković was selected to head the "Temporary Central Board of the Organization of Ottoman Serbs" in July 1908. Bishop Vicentije Krdzić of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Skopje headed the clergy and Bogdan Radenković the lay membership of the  "Assembly of Ottoman Serbs in Skopje", held on Sretenje in 1909. These organizations included the Serb elite of Old Raška, Kosovo and Metohija, and Vardar Macedonia and Aegean Macedonia.[1] It included many members of the Serbian Chetnik Organization as well. They were: Bogdan Radenković; Aleksandar Bukvić; Gligorije "Gliša" Elezović; Vasa Jovanović; Milan Čemerikić; Sava Stojanović; David Dimitrijević; Đorđe Hadzi-Kostić; Velimir Prelić and Jovan Šantrić._NEWLINE_With the founding of the Serb Democratic League, it became the first political party to represent the interests of the Serbs in the Ottoman Empire.The Serbian Democratic League sent to Thessaloniki Bogdan Radenković, Jovan Šantrić and Đorđe Hadži-Kostić to negotiate with the Central Young Turk Board.

There was a conflict within the Serbian Church regarding the appointment of Gavrilo; the "Old Serbs" (clergy from Kosovo and Old Serbia) wanted their candidate, the previous secretary of the Eparchy of Skoplje, monk Vasilije (Bogdan) Radenković. While waiting for the Ottoman government approval, the Serbian government changed the decision and ordered through the consuls that Ottoman Serbs request that Radenković be appointed instead. However, Gavrilo ended up being chosen. Meanwhile, Radenković became a founder of the Black Hand conspiracy group. _START_SECTION_ Secret Mission in Korçë _START_PARAGRAPH_ After the occupation of Serbia in late 1915 by the Germans, Austrians, Hungarians and Bulgarians, Bogdan Radenković withdrew through Montenegro, Albania to the island of Corfu, where he was temporarily hospitalized with tuberculosis. When his condition improved somewhat he was sent to Athens and from there to Korçë County in eastern Albania. There he stayed until  August 1916 when a surprise Bulgarian invasion took place and he was forced to flee. He was almost caught while escaping but eventually managed to reach Thessaloniki, where the Serbian Supreme Command was stationed. Weak, suffering from tuberculosis after the harrowing escape from Korçë, he was advised by his doctor to go to Egypt where the climate may improve his condition. Nikola Pašić, however, purposefully delayed his departure until his condition worsened. _START_SECTION_ High Military Court _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Serbian Supreme Command on 15 March 1917 sent a warrant for Bogdan Radenković's arrest, though the main accused was Dragutin Dimitrijević, better known as Apis, and his associates. Radenković was sentenced to death for allegedly plotting against the prince regent Aleksandar Karadjordjević and Nikola Pašić, the head of the Serbian government-in-exile, even though there was no concrete evidence that could link him to such an outrageous plot, not him nor Dimitrijević and others._NEWLINE_Bogdan Radenković died of tuberculosis in a prison hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece on 30 July 1917. Years later it was revealed that Nikola Pašić fabricated the story to rid himself of Dragutin Dimitrijević and other Serbian nationalists that may pose a threat after the war during election time. All the accused were vindicated, but many years later.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Super Mario Bros. 3 _START_SECTION_ Gameplay _START_PARAGRAPH_ Super Mario Bros. 3 is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls either Mario or Luigi. The game shares similar gameplay mechanics with previous games in the series — Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan, and Super Mario Bros. 2 internationally — while introducing several new elements. In addition to running and jumping found in past games, the player can slide down slopes, pick up and throw special blocks, and freely climb vines. Mario can also fly and float with power-ups. The game world consists of eight kingdoms, each subdivided into multiple levels. The eight worlds feature distinct visual themes: for example, the second world, "Desert Land", contains sand-covered levels with pyramids, while the levels in the fourth world, "Giant Land", contain obstacles and enemies four times their normal size._NEWLINE_The player navigates through the game via two game screens: an overworld map and a level playfield. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current kingdom and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the kingdom's goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or fortress will allow access to that level's playfield, a linear stage populated with obstacles and  enemies. The majority of the game takes place in these levels, with the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, flying, swimming, and dodging or defeating enemies. Players start with a certain number of lives and may gain additional lives by picking up green spotted 1-Up mushrooms hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario and Luigi lose a life if they take damage while small, fall in a bottomless pit, or run out of time. The game ends when all lives are lost, although the player can continue from the last level played by selecting "Continue"._NEWLINE_Completing stages allows the player to progress through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat. The first seven worlds feature an airship controlled by one of the Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world as the Final boss. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths. Mini-games and bonus screens on the map provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve until activated by the player from the map screen._NEWLINE_In addition to special items from previous games like the Super Mushroom and the Fire Flower, new power-ups are introduced that provide the player with new options. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit give Mario raccoon and tanooki appearances, allowing him to fly. The Tanooki Suit enables him to turn into stone to avoid enemies for a short period of time. Changing into a Tanooki statue while jumping results in Mario pounding the ground and killing whatever enemies are directly under him; this is the first appearance of the now standard "ground pound" move in the Mario series. The new "Frog Suit" increases the character's underwater speed, agility, and jumping height on land. Another new suit, the Hammer Suit, gives Mario the appearance of the Hammer Bro. enemy and allows him to throw hammers at enemies and resist fire attacks when crouching._NEWLINE_Super Mario Bros. 3 includes a multiplayer option which allows two players to play the game by taking turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels. The first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (a palette swap of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, in which one player has the opportunity to steal the cards of another, but may lose their turn if they lose the mini-game. _START_SECTION_ Plot and characters _START_PARAGRAPH_ The plot of Super Mario Bros. 3 is described in the instruction booklet. The Mushroom World, the setting of the game, is invaded by the Koopalings, Bowser's seven children. The Koopalings conquer each of the seven kingdoms by stealing its king's magical wand and using it to transform him into an animal. Princess Toadstool sends Mario and Luigi to travel to each kingdom, retrieve the stolen wand, and restore its king to normal._NEWLINE_Mario and Luigi receive notes and special items from Princess Toadstool after rescuing each of the first six kings. When they rescue the seventh king, they instead receive a note from Bowser, boasting that he has kidnapped Toadstool and imprisoned her within the castle of his own realm, Dark Land. The brothers travel through Dark Land, enter his castle, and defeat Bowser in a battle. The game ends with Princess Toadstool being freed from the castle._NEWLINE_Super Mario Bros. 3 was conceived as a stage play. The title screen features a stage curtain being drawn open, and in-game objects hang from off-screen catwalks, are bolted to the background, or cast shadows on the skyline. When Mario finishes a level, he walks off the stage. _START_SECTION_ Development _START_PARAGRAPH_ Beginning development shortly after the 1986 release of the Famicom's Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3 was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, a team that consisted of more than ten people. The game took more than two years to complete at a budget of about $800,000. Developer Shigeru Miyamoto served as director. He worked closely with the designers and programmers during the conceptual and final stages, encouraging a free interchange of ideas. Miyamoto considered intriguing and original ideas to be key to creating a successful game. Originally, the team intended for the game to be played from an isometric point of view, but the developers found that this made it too difficult to position jumps, so the game was changed to the 2D side view used in previous games. Some isometric elements remain, such as the checkered floor present in the title screen._NEWLINE_The game was designed to appeal to players of varying skill levels. To assist less skilled players, bonus coins and 1-ups are more abundant in earlier worlds, while later worlds present more complex challenges for experienced players. In the two-player mode, the players alternate turns to balance play time. The development team introduced new power-ups and concepts that would give Mario the appearance of different creatures as a means of providing him with new abilities. An early idea changed Mario into a centaur, but was dropped in favor of a raccoon tail with limited flying ability. Other costumes with different abilities were added to his repertoire, and levels were designed to take advantage of these abilities. New enemies were included to add diversity to the game, along with variants of previous enemies, such as Goombas, Hammer Bros., and Koopa Troopas._NEWLINE_Some of the enemies designed for Super Mario Bros. 3 were inspired by the team's personal experiences. For example, Miyamoto stated that the Chain Chomp enemy, a tethered ball and chain creature that lunges at the player when in close proximity, was based on a "bad [childhood] experience" he had with a dog. Bowser's children, the Koopalings, were designed to be unique in appearance and personality; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work and efforts. Nintendo of America named the Koopalings after well-known musicians: for example, the characters "Ludwig von Koopa" and "Roy Koopa" are named after Ludwig van Beethoven and Roy Orbison respectively._NEWLINE_The character graphics were created with a special graphics machine ("Character Generator Computer Aided Design") that generated a collection of the graphical shapes used in the game. Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game's code used to access and combine to form complete images on the screen in real time. The Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge uses Nintendo's custom MMC3 (memory management controller) ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities.  The MMC3 chip allows for animated tiles, extra RAM for diagonal scrolling, and a scan line timer to split the screen. The game uses these functions to split the game screen into two portions, a playfield on the top and a status bar on the bottom. This allows the top portion to scroll as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to display text and other information._NEWLINE_Like its predecessors, the music in Super Mario Bros. 3 was composed by Koji Kondo, who composed several new songs as well as returning melodies from Super Mario Bros. According to Kondo, who had composed the music in Super Mario Bros. based on what he believed fit the levels rather than focusing on composing a specific genre of music, the game was the most difficult game for him to compose. Kondo experimented with several different genres of music, unsure of how to follow up the music from the first game after hearing from several people that it sounded a lot like latin or fusion music, and came up with several different melodies throughout its development before settling on what ultimately made it into the game. The development team decided that music on the title screen was unnecessary._NEWLINE_During 1988, a global shortage of ROM chips, along with Nintendo's preparation of Super Mario Bros. 2, prevented Nintendo from performing various North American game releases according to their original schedules. The delayed products included Super Mario Bros. 3 and, according to Nintendo Power, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The delay, however, presented Nintendo with an opportunity to promote the game in a feature film. In 1989, Tom Pollack of Universal Studios approached Nintendo of America's marketing department about a video game movie; inspired by Nintendo video game competitions, Pollack envisioned a video game version of Tommy for younger audiences. Nintendo licensed its products for inclusion in what would become the film The Wizard. During the movie's production, the filmmakers requested and were granted approval from Nintendo regarding the script and the portrayal of the company's games. Super Mario Bros. 3 was one of the products shown in the film and was used in a final scene involving a video game competition. The film was released in December 1989, between the Japanese and English versions of the game. _START_SECTION_ Sales _START_PARAGRAPH_ Super Mario Bros. 3 became a best-selling game. Its inclusion in The Wizard served as a preview which generated a high level of anticipation in the United States prior to its release. Levi Buchanan of IGN considered Super Mario Bros. 3's appearance in the film as a show-stealing element, referring to the movie as a "90-minute commercial" for the game. The game sold 250,000 copies in its first two days of release, according to a spokeswoman for Nintendo. By 1993, the game had sold 4 and 7 million unbundled units in Japan and the United States respectively. In the United States alone, the game generated over US$500 million in revenue for Nintendo. Author David Sheff commented that, in music industry terms, the game went platinum 11 times. The game was later bundled with new NES systems. Including bundled units, the NES version of the game sold over 17 million copies. Game Informer reported in their October 2009 issue that the Virtual Console version had sold one million copies. As of 2011, Super Mario Bros. 3 remains the highest-grossing non-bundled home video game to date, having grossed $1.7 billion, adjusted for inflation. _START_SECTION_ Legacy _START_PARAGRAPH_ Super Mario Bros. 3 introduced several elements carried over to subsequent Mario games. A similar overworld map is used in Super Mario World and New Super Mario Bros., and Mario's ability to fly has been a feature in games such as Super Mario World, Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy. The game's "Super Leaf" item has returned in more recent Mario games for the Nintendo 3DS, like Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7  and  New Super Mario Bros. 2. Bowser's red hair was first popularized in the game and has since become a part of his standard appearance._NEWLINE_Through a collaboration between NBC and Nintendo of America, an animated television series, The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3, was created in 1990 by DIC Entertainment. The show aired weekly and featured numerous characters, enemies, and settings from the video game; the original seven Koopalings are given different names based on their given personalities and are also given a new age order. Other Nintendo products have included various elements of the game as well. Music from Super Mario Bros. 3 appears as a track on Nintendo Sound Selection Koopa, a collection of songs from Nintendo games. The game's stages and graphics comprise a background theme in the 2006 Nintendo DS game Tetris DS. The Koopalings are also world bosses in Super Mario World, Mario is Missing!, Yoshi's Safari, Hotel Mario and all New Super Mario Bros. games except New Super Mario Bros. Boom Boom, another boss from this game, additionally reappears in Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World, alongside a boomerang-wielding female counterpart named Pom Pom. Super Mario Bros. 3 is one of the games represented in both Super Mario Maker and Super Mario Maker 2._NEWLINE_Super Mario Bros. 3 has appeared on numerous top video game lists. The game debuted on Nintendo Power's Top 30 best games ever list at number 20 in September 1989. It entered the list's top 10 a few months later and reached number one in May 1990. Super Mario Bros. 3 remained within the top 20 for more than five years. More than a decade later, the magazine ranked the game number six on their list of 200 Greatest Nintendo Games. In August 2008, Nintendo Power listed Super Mario Bros. 3 as the second best NES video game, praising it for making the series more complex and introducing new abilities that have since become signature abilities in the series. The game placed 11th, behind Super Mario Bros., in Official Nintendo Magazine's "100 greatest Nintendo games of all time". In 2007, ScrewAttack called Super Mario Bros. 3 the best Mario game in the series as well as the best game on the NES, citing the graphics, power-ups, secrets, and popularity, summing it up as "just incredible" and stating, "If you haven't experienced this greatness, we pity you". In a poll conducted by Dengeki, the game tied with Super Mario World as the number three video game their readers first played._NEWLINE_The game has been ranked on several of IGN's lists of "top games". In 2005, they rated it 23rd among their Top 100 Games, and praised the precise and intuitive controls. IGN editors from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia ranked Super Mario Bros. 3 number 39 in their 2007 Top 100 Games, citing Miyamoto's "ingenious" designs. They further commented that the game improved on the "already-brilliant concepts" of the previous games with new power-ups and enemies. Users and readers of the website placed the game high on similar lists: 32nd in 2005 and 21st in 2006. In 2007, the game was included in the "game canon", a list of the ten most important video games selected for preservation by the Library of Congress. In 2009, Game Informer put Super Mario Bros. 3 9th on their list of "The Top 200 Games of All Time", saying that it is "a game with incredible lasting power that we won't soon forget". This is down one place from Game Informer's previous ranking in 2001. Edge ranked the game #20 on its list of "The 100 Best Games To Play Today", calling it "the one 8-bit game that still shines today, no caveats required." UGO listed Super Mario Bros. 3 on their list of the "Top 50 Games That Belong On the 3DS", calling it "Arguably the greatest Mario game ever made." GameSpot placed the game on their list of the greatest games of all time. USgamer ranked the game as the third best Mario platformer ever. Super Mario Bros. 3 ranked 34th on Warp Zoned's "Scientifically Proven Best Video Games of All Time" list, a statistical meta-analysis of 44 "top games" lists published between 1995 and 2016._NEWLINE_In the early 1990s, game developers John Carmack and Tom Hall developed an adaptive tile refresh technology to perform smooth, side-scrolling graphics on EGA cards for IBM clone personal computers. They used it to develop a clone of Super Mario Bros. 3 and presented it to Nintendo, who rejected it to retain exclusivity for their games on Nintendo consoles. Carmack and Hall went on to found Id Software and develop Commander Keen, a series of platform games inspired by Super Mario Bros. 3. _START_SECTION_ Remakes _START_PARAGRAPH_ The game has been ported or remade on several other Nintendo consoles. It was included in the 1993 Super NES game Super Mario All-Stars, a compilation of remakes of NES Super Mario games featuring updated graphics and sound, which was also later released on the Wii in 2010. A Game Boy Advance version, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, was released in 2003. This version features support for the Nintendo e-Reader peripheral, which allows the player to access additional levels stored on e-Reader cards, in addition to updated graphics, power-ups, and sound._NEWLINE_Super Mario Bros. 3 was rereleased in emulation as a downloadable Virtual Console game in 2007 for the Wii and in 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U consoles. It is one of thirty pre-installed games in the NES Classic Edition console, and is on the Nintendo Switch Online service.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Mobile Public Library _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Mobile Public Library has roots going back to the 1850s, when it was started as a subscription organization by the Franklin Society.  The library was officially established as the Mobile Public Library in 1902 and was originally housed in an antebellum structure at the corner of Conti and Hamilton Street.  The library association appealed to city leaders in the late 1910s to provide operating funds for the library, and it offered to give the city the library property if it would build a new building to house the collections.  The city declined to finance the construction of a new building, but did approve operating funds on 2 April 1918.  _NEWLINE_Due to increasing public demand for a library, on 15 December 1925, the city commissioners voted to schedule a special election on a $250,000 bond issue.  The voters approved the bond and, along with a gift of $30,000 from Eli H. Bernheim of New York City, the new library building was constructed. Noted Mobile architect George Bigelow Rogers designed the building in the Classical Revival style.  The new structure, now known as the Ben May Main Library, was opened on 15 September 1928._NEWLINE_The state had passed racial segregation laws at the turn of the century after disenfranchising most blacks and many poor whites in the state, excluding them from politics. Mobile's African-American community did not have access to a public library until one was completed for them in 1931; it was known as the Davis Avenue Branch. It was also designed by George Bigelow Rogers. It was funded by a city bond issue and the city's sale of the old library property on Conti Street._NEWLINE_The Ben May Main Library building is a contributing building to the Church Street East Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 16 December 1971.  The system opened a new branch, the West Regional Branch, in 2002, with First Lady Laura Bush making an address. Beginning in 2006, the Ben May Main Library building was restored and expanded by 22,000 square feet (2,000 m²). It was reopened on 31 May 2007. _START_SECTION_ Services _START_PARAGRAPH_ In addition to basic services, participation in several interlibrary loan systems, and internet access at all locations, the Mobile Public Library provides a range of other services. Free library cards are made available to all residents in the Alabama counties of Baldwin, Washington, Clarke, Monroe, Escambia and Conecuh. Alabama Virtual Library (AVL) cards are also made available for free at all branches. _START_SECTION_ Local history and genealogy _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Local History and Genealogy Division includes works by local authors, Mobile histories, periodicals, Mobile newspapers on microfilm from 1819 to the present, city directories from 1837 onward, federal census records for most of the Southeastern United States, and the Mobile Historic Development Commission's survey of historic architecture in Mobile with 10,000 images stored and indexed on CD-ROM. _START_SECTION_ Youth services _START_PARAGRAPH_ This department attempts to meet the needs and interests of children and young adults through the various library collections, services and programs.  Books, movie DVDs and VHS, music CDs, audiobooks, back issues of magazines, and video games are available to be checked out.  Story time for young children is provided at most library locations. _START_SECTION_ Disabilities _START_PARAGRAPH_ All branches provide handicapped access, materials, and services for patrons with disabilities. A few of the services provided are magnifying glasses, large type books, closed captioned videos, books for and about the handicapped, and instructional books and videos on sign language.  In addition, recorded books on discs and cassettes and the equipment for using them are available on free loan to eligible individuals from the Alabama Regional Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in Montgomery, Alabama. _START_SECTION_ Bookmobile _START_PARAGRAPH_ The library operates a bookmobile three days a week at over 30 different stops across Mobile County. Each location is visited every three weeks.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Daugherty Furniture Building _START_SECTION_ History _START_PARAGRAPH_ The furniture store was originally located in Fork Mountain, Tennessee, but was moved to Clinton in the late 1930s because of the population growth of Anderson County. More than 75,000 individuals had moved to the area in a two-year period, and the demand for household items was high. Daugherty Furniture Store served as the only "one-stop shop" for Anderson County residents. The store offered home delivery, with a fleet of delivery trucks. The third and fourth floors of the building served as apartments, which housed Oak Ridge workers and scientists in need of housing in a region running out of housing options. The business expanded into the nearby regions, and the main location served as a meeting place for local businessmen. The attention and popularity of the main location helped to develop the neighborhood of Market and Main Streets in Clinton._NEWLINE_The store was owned and operated by the family, and most of the employees were family members. Daugherty's brothers, Leonard, Emmitt, and Laford, worked for the shop, with Leonard serving as a manager overseeing deliveries and purchases. Their sons, along with Daugherty's sons, all worked at the store and remained working there until its closing in 1985. All employees were trained to be familiar with the store's merchandise, including demonstrating Singer sewing machines. Employees also provided repair services, both in-store and in the homes of customers. Many employees lived in the upstairs apartments, and Daugherty lived in the corner unit and oversaw the company until his death in 1985. _START_SECTION_ Architecture _START_PARAGRAPH_ The original building was located in Fork Mountain, Tennessee, and was a simple one-story building. When Daugherty moved to Clinton in 1935, he rented two buildings across the street from where the current building stands. While planning to build a new location, he found inspiration in a building in Oak Ridge owned by Elza Gate. Gate's home, known as the Glenn Copeland House, was entirely faced in stone (except the roof). Daugherty would use Frank Gilbreath as an advisor on building his store; Gilbreath served as stonemason on the Glenn Copeland House._NEWLINE_When Daugherty began exploring options for building his store, his friends and colleagues advised him to avoid building a multi-story building. He hired architect Clem H. Meyer, who had designed Huntsville High School in Scott County, Tennessee. Oba Hill was also hired, who worked alongside Gilbreath on the stone work._NEWLINE_About 99,000 pounds of locally quarried stone was used on the buildings exterior, most which came from areas near the New River region of Morgan County and Scruggs Farm in Bethel. All of the stone was hand-chiseled and laid by Gilbreath and Sebastian Marie, another local stone cutter. When the building was complete, in 1942, it was the largest commercial building in Clinton, along with Magnet Mills, Inc._NEWLINE_The Daugherty Furniture Building doesn't touch on traditional architectural styles, but serves as an example of vernacular architecture, by using local construction methods and materials. The buildings interior, from the fourth floor to the basement, looks like an inverted step pyramid. The load bearing walls are stair-stepped, therefor the fifth floor walls are thinner than those in the basement; the basement walls are 26 inches thick, with the fifth floor being 12 inches. The architecture of the building was also influenced by Meyer's work on Huntsville High School, using techniques found in that project. Examples include the rectangular shape, stone exterior, and rectangular steel windows. The design is also minimalistic, reflecting the wartime emphasis on simplicity seen in design during the period.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Waka (poetry) _START_SECTION_ Etymology _START_PARAGRAPH_ The word waka has two different but related meanings: the original meaning was "poetry in Japanese" and encompassed several genres such as chōka and sedōka (discussed below); the later, more common definition refers to poetry in a 5-7-5-7-7 metre. Up to and during the compilation of the Man'yōshū in the eighth century, the word waka was a general term for poetry composed in Japanese, and included several genres such as tanka (短歌, "short poem"), chōka (長歌, "long poem"), bussokusekika (仏足石歌, "Buddha footprint poem") and sedōka (旋頭歌, "repeating-the-first-part poem"). However, by the time of the Kokinshū's compilation at the beginning of the tenth century, all of these forms except for the tanka and chōka had effectively gone extinct, and chōka had significantly diminished in prominence. As a result, the word waka became effectively synonymous with tanka, and the word tanka fell out of use until it was revived at the end of the nineteenth century (see Tanka)._NEWLINE_Tanka (hereafter referred to as waka) consist of five lines (句 ku, literally "phrases") of 5-7-5-7-7 on or syllabic units.　Therefore, tanka is sometimes called Misohitomoji (三十一文字), meaning it contains 31 syllables in total. _START_SECTION_ Kamakura and Muromachi periods _START_PARAGRAPH_ After the Heian period, during the Kamakura period and later, renga, a form of collaborative linked poetry, began to develop. In the late Heian period, three of the last great waka poets appeared: Fujiwara no Shunzei, his son Fujiwara no Teika, and Emperor Go-Toba. Emperor Go-Toba ordered the creation of a new anthology and joined in editing it. The anthology was named Shin Kokin Wakashū. He edited it again and again until he died in 1239. Teika made copies of ancient books and wrote on the theory of waka. His descendants, and indeed almost all subsequent poets, such as Shōtetsu, taught his methods and studied his poems. The courtly poetry scenes were historically dominated by a few noble clans and allies, each of which staked out a position._NEWLINE_By this period, a number of clans had fallen by the wayside, leaving the Reizei and the Nijō families; the former stood for "progressive" approaches, the varied use of the "ten styles" and novelty, while the latter conservatively hewed to already established norms and the "ushin" (deep feelings) style that dominated courtly poetry. Eventually, the Nijo family became defunct, leading to the ascendancy of the "liberal" Reizei family.  Their innovative reign was soon deposed by the Asukai family, aided by the Ashikaga shōgun, Ashikaga Yoshinori._NEWLINE_In the Muromachi period, renga became popular in the court and people around it. It spread to the priestly classes and thence to wealthy commoners. In much the same way as waka, renga anthologies were produced under the imperial aegis.  As momentum and popular interest shifted to the renga form, the tanka style was left to the Imperial court. Conservative tendencies exacerbated the loss of life and flexibility. A tradition named Kokin-denju, the heritage of Kokin Wakashū, was developed. It was a system on how to analyze the Kokin Wakashū and included the secret (or precisely lost) meaning of words. Studying waka degenerated into learning the many intricate rules, allusions,  theories, and secrets, so as to produce tanka that would be accepted by the court._NEWLINE_There were comical waka already in the Kojiki and the Man'yōshū, but the noble style of waka in the court inhibited and scorned such aspects of waka. Renga was soon in the same position with many codes and strictures reflecting literary tradition. Haikai no renga (also called just haikai (playful renga)) and kyōka, comical waka, were a reaction to this seriousness. But in the Edo-period waka itself lost almost all of its flexibility and began to echo and repeat old poems and themes. _START_SECTION_ Edo period (1603–1867) _START_PARAGRAPH_ In the early Edo period, waka was not a fashionable genre. Newly created haikai no renga (of whose hokku, or opening verse, haiku was a late 19th-century revision) was the favored genre. This tendency was kept during this period, but in the late Edo period waka faced new trends from beyond the court. Motoori Norinaga, the great reviver of the traditional Japanese literature, attempted to revive waka as a way of providing "traditional feeling expressed in genuine Japanese way". He wrote waka, and waka became an important form to his followers, the Kokugaku scholars._NEWLINE_In Echigo Province a Buddhist priest, Ryōkan, composed many waka in a naïve style intentionally avoiding complex rules and the traditional way of waka. He belonged to another great tradition of waka: waka for expressing religious feeling. His frank expression of his feeling found many admirers, then and now. In the cities, a comical, ironic and satiric form of waka emerged. It was called kyōka (狂歌), mad poem, and was loved by intellectual people in big cities like Edo and Osaka. It was not precisely a new form; satirical waka was a style known since ancient times. But it was in the Edo period that this aspect of waka developed and reached an artistic peak. Still, most waka poets kept to ancient tradition or made those reformation another stereotype, and waka was not a vibrant genre in general at the end of this period.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Ireland–Spain relations _START_SECTION_ Early relations _START_PARAGRAPH_ The first awareness and contact between both nations was through stories about Celtic migration from Iberia to Ireland as mentioned in the Lebor Gabála Érenn regarding the Milesians. The first diplomatic contact between Irish and Spanish nobility happened in April 1529 when the Spanish ambassador, Don Gonzalez Fernandez, visited Ireland and met with The 10th Earl of Desmond. The agreement, known as the Treaty of Dingle, gave a formal legal and constitutional foundation to the rights of citizenship and other privileges that Irish exiles and emigrés enjoyed in Habsburg Spain, Habsburg Austria and Habsburg Netherlands from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. Both nations felt united in their common beliefs of Catholicism, but this was not an issue in 1529. In 1554-58 Philip Prince of Asturias was married to Mary I and was named as titular King of Ireland in the Papal Bull Ilius ad quem. As a result, during the first plantations of Ireland what is now County Offaly was shired as "King's County", and Philipstown (now Daingean) was named in his honour, the first Irish place named after someone from Spain. Soon after Mary's death he succeeded as Philip II of Spain._NEWLINE_In 1601, Spain supported Irish rebels fighting against England during the Nine Years War, and especially during the Siege of Kinsale. At the time, the Catholics of Ireland saw Spain as a potential liberator of their country from Protestant England and in 1595 Hugh O'Neill offered the crown of Ireland to Philip II of Spain. Philip refused the offer, having already been the titular King of Ireland. _NEWLINE_Many Irishmen in rebellion against English rule subsequently sought refuge in Spain following the Flight of the Earls (1607), and for the next two centuries Irish soldiers contributed to Spanish Army of Flanders and fought side-by-side during the Dutch Revolts and during the Thirty Years' War. During the Anglo-Spanish War (1625–1630) proposals were made in 1627 to launch an invasion of Ireland under Shane O'Neill and Hugh O'Donnell, but did not go further than the planning stage._NEWLINE_Irish soldiers in the service of Spain also participated in the colonization of the Americas. Several prominent Spanish officials of Irish origin governed and administered Spanish colonies as Viceroy's such as Ambrosio O'Higgins in Peru and Juan O'Donojú in Mexico or became ministers in the Spanish government, most notably Leopoldo O'Donnell and his relatives Carlos O'Donnell and Juan O'Donnell. At the same time, during the independence wars of Gran Colombia, several thousand Irish soldiers fought for South America against Spain and made up parts of the British Legions. _START_SECTION_ Independence for the Republic of Ireland and the Spanish Civil War _START_PARAGRAPH_ In January 1801, Ireland became a part of the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and all relations between Ireland and Spain were henceforth carried out through the Court of St James's. Napoleon's Irish Legion took part in suppressing the Dos de Mayo Uprising. After the Napoleonic Wars the Regiment of Hibernia was disbanded at the demand of their British allies._NEWLINE_In December 1922, most of Ireland gained a form of independence within the British Empire as the Irish Free State and, in 1924, diplomatic relations were officially established between the new Irish Free State and the Kingdom of Spain. That same year, Spain opened its first consulate in Dublin. In 1935, the first Irish Minister was appointed to Spain with residence in Madrid._NEWLINE_In 1936, Spain was engulfed in a Civil War between the Republican faction led by President Manuel Azaña; and the Nationalist faction led by General Francisco Franco. The Free State was a member of the Non-intervention Committee. However, Ireland (North and South) was divided in opinion over the war. Many Irish Catholics sided with Francisco Franco. A smaller number sided with the Spanish Republican faction. In 1936 the Irish Christian Front was established to financially support Francisco Franco and the Irish Brigade was created to fight for the Nationalist side and contributed 700 Irish volunteer soldiers to Franco. The Irish-American politician Joe Kennedy stopped the US Congress from supplying arms to the Republic. At the same time, 250 Irish socialist volunteers joined the International Brigades and fought for the Spanish Republican faction. Both Irish factions took part in the Battle of Jarama in February 1937. By the summer of 1937, the Irish Brigade was "disarmed and ordered out of Spain by Franco" (Fearghal McGarry); most of the socialists stayed until late 1938, although they were frequently treated as pariahs on their return home, and many emigrated to the UK. After the war ended in 1939, the Irish Minister presented his credentials in Burgos and formally recognized the new Spanish government under General Franco. _START_SECTION_ Post-war relations _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 1973, both Northern Ireland (as part of the United Kingdom) and the Republic of Ireland joined the European Economic Community (EEC), and Spain followed suit in 1986. In July 1986, King Juan Carlos I of Spain paid his first official visit to the Republic of Ireland. In 1993, Mary Robinson became the first Irish President to pay an official visit to Spain. Since then, there have been numerous visits between leaders of both states. Recently, in January 2017, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny paid a visit to Spain._NEWLINE_Spain has increasingly become an important tourist destination for Irish travelers. In 2016, 1.4 million Irish citizens visited Spain for tourism. At the same time, 263,000 Spanish tourists visited Ireland. In 2016, 35,000 Spanish nationals studied English in Ireland. Several Irish and Spanish airlines provide direct services between both nations. _START_SECTION_ Bilateral agreements _START_PARAGRAPH_ Both the Republic of Ireland and Spain have signed several bilateral agreements (mostly prior to both states joining the European Union), such as an Agreement on the Exchange of Diplomatic Pouches (1935); Agreement on the Exchange of Information regarding Meteorology (1950); Extradition Treaty (1957); Cultural Cooperation Agreement (1980); Spanish Agreement on Renouncing Historic Rights of Fishing in Irish Waters (1980) and an Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation (1994). _START_SECTION_ Trade _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 2015, trade between the Republic of Ireland and Spain totaled 4.5 billion Euros.

The bay has a long naval and civilian history. _START_SECTION_ New-York Province and the American Revolution _START_PARAGRAPH_ Fort Pond Bay was first listed by name in a 1655 map published in 1680 by John Scott which makes note of a Montaukett Native-American fort on its banks._NEWLINE_Early settlers in the area raised cattle and sheep on the bluffs above the bay. During the American Revolutionary War during the Siege of Boston British warships sailed into the bay in 1775. Local militia under Captain John Dayton, feigned they had more men than they had, turning their coats inside out as they marched back and forth on top of a high hill to the south. The tactic is called Dayton's Ruse._NEWLINE_Long Island was occupied throughout the war and the bay was used by the British for their blockade of Connecticut. In 1781 HMS Culloden ran aground while pursuing a French frigate during a January storm. The ship, which survived the initial ground hit a rock and had to be scuttled in the bay at Culloden Point and burned with its canons thrown overboard. Its debris field and wreck site is now the only underwater park on Long Island._NEWLINE_In the late 18th century, the small fishing village of Montauk was established at the southeast corner of the bay. _START_SECTION_ The 19th century and today _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 1839 the slave ship Amistad anchored in bay (also at Culloden Point) when the surviving crew tried to convince their revolted slave captors that they had returned to Africa as they went for provisions in the village of Montauk. The ship was seized by the USS Washington in the bay._NEWLINE_In the 1890s, Austin Corbin extended the Long Island Rail Road from Bridgehampton, New York to the Montauk fishing village (the line extension was called the Fort Pond Railway). His friend Arthur Bensen purchased 10,000 acres (40 km²) of Montaukett land around the village and the LIRR began advertising that it could cut a day off ship travel by docking in Montauk and taking the train rather than going to New York. Corbin built a steel pier into pond for the overseas ships (even as the Corps of Engineers continued to caution against using the bay because of rocks._NEWLINE_The dream was never to materialize and the U.S. Army bought the land for Camp Wikoff. Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders were to come by transport into the bay following the Spanish–American War at the camp to be quarantined over concerns about yellow fever._NEWLINE_The fishing village was obliterated in the storm of the Great Hurricane of 1938. The Navy took over the area for a seaplane and dirigible base during World War II (the dock is still in use). The Montauk fishing village was moved a mile south closer to the Atlantic Ocean._NEWLINE_During the years after World War II, the bay ceased to be used by most boats because of flooding and rocks. Boats now dock in the dredged Lake Montauk. In the 1960s the bluffs above the bay were used to build Leisurama homes as inexpensive second homes that had been inspired by the Kitchen Debate between Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Resettable fuse _START_SECTION_ Operation _START_PARAGRAPH_ A polymeric PTC device is made up of a non-conductive crystalline organic polymer matrix that is loaded with carbon black particles to make it conductive. While cool, the polymer is in a crystalline state, with the carbon forced into the regions between crystals, forming many conductive chains.  Since it is conductive (the "initial resistance"), it will pass a current. If too much current is passed through the device the device will begin to heat. As the device heats, the polymer will expand, changing from a crystalline into an amorphous state. The expansion separates the carbon particles and breaks the conductive pathways, causing the device to heat faster and expand more, further raising the resistance.  This increase in resistance substantially reduces the current in the circuit. A small (leakage) current still flows through the device and is sufficient to maintain the temperature at a level which will keep it in the high resistance state.  Leakage current can range from less than a hundred mA at rated voltage up to a few hundred mA at lower voltages. The device can be said to have latching functionality. The hold current is the maximum current at which the device is guaranteed not to trip. The trip current is the current at which the device is guaranteed to trip._NEWLINE_When power is removed, the heating due to the leakage current will stop and the PPTC device will cool. As the device cools, it regains its original crystalline structure and returns to a low resistance state where it can hold the current as specified for the device. This cooling usually takes a few seconds, though a tripped device will retain a slightly higher resistance for hours, unless the power in it is weaker, or has been often used, slowly approaching the initial resistance value. The resetting will often not take place even if the fault alone has been removed with the power still flowing as the operating current may be above the holding current of the PPTC.  The device may not return to its original resistance value;  it will most likely stabilize at a significantly higher resistance (up to 4 times initial value). It could take hours, days, weeks or even years for the device to return to a resistance value similar to its original value, if at all._NEWLINE_A PPTC device has a current rating and a voltage rating. _START_SECTION_ Applications _START_PARAGRAPH_ These devices are often used in computer power supplies, largely due to the PC 97 standard (which recommends a sealed PC that the user never has to open), and in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult. Another application for such devices is protecting audio loudspeakers, particularly tweeters, from damage when over driven: by putting a resistor or light bulb in parallel with the PPTC device it is possible to design a circuit that limits total current through the tweeter to a safe value instead of cutting it off, allowing the speaker to continue operating without damage when the amplifier is delivering more power than the tweeter could tolerate.  While a fuse could also offer similar protection, if the fuse is blown, the tweeter cannot operate until the fuse is replaced. _START_SECTION_ Device trade names _START_PARAGRAPH_ These devices are sold by different companies under various trademarks, including Multifuse (Bourns), PolySwitch (TE Connectivity), and Polyfuse (Littelfuse).  PolySwitch is the earliest product of this type, having been invented at Raychem Corporation (now TE Connectivity) and introduced in the early 1980s.  Due to common availability, electronics engineers and technicians often refer to this device as a "polyswitch" or "polyfuse", in the generic sense, regardless of actual brand.

Working deep undercover, Stierlitz tries to collect intelligence about the Germans' war plans and communicate it to Moscow. He receives instructions from Moscow on how to proceed, on one occasion traveling to Switzerland on a secret mission. He diverts the German nuclear "Vengeance Weapon" research program into a fruitless dead-end, thwarts separate peace talks between Nazi Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, engages in intellectual games with members of the Nazi high command and sacrifices his own happiness for the good of his motherland. Despite being wracked with desire to return home to his wife he subordinates his feelings to his duty, thus embodying an idealised Soviet vision of patriotism._NEWLINE_Stierlitz is quite an opposite of the action-oriented James Bond; most of the time he gains his knowledge without any Bond-style stunts and gadgets, while in the film adaptation of the stories the action is presented through a narrative voice-over by Yefim Kopelyan. He is presented in a deeply patriotic but non-ideological light, fighting to defend the Soviet motherland against external enemies rather than just defending the Communist government against its ideological opponents. _START_SECTION_ Influences in Russian life and culture _START_PARAGRAPH_ Although Stierlitz was a much-loved character, he was also the butt of a common genre of Russian jokes, often satirising his deductive trains of thought, with unexpected twists, delivered in the deadpan style of the voice-overs in the film adaptations; for example:_NEWLINE_Stierlitz approaches Berlin. The city is veiled in smoke from the fires. "Forgot to switch off the iron again," thought Stierlitz with slight irritation._NEWLINE_Stierlitz continues to be a popular character in modern Russia. Despite the fact that references and Stierlitz jokes still penetrate contemporary speech, Seventeen Moments of Spring is very popular mainly because it is quite patriotic. It is repeated annually on Russian television, usually around Victory Day. Stierlitz also continues to have a political significance. When his portrayer Vyacheslav Tikhonov died in December 2009, the Foreign Intelligence Service—one of the successor organisations of the former Soviet KGB—sent its condolences to his family. Ivan Zassoursky notes that Russian Prime Minister (and former and current President) Vladimir Putin, a former KGB agent, has been portrayed as "embod[ying] the image—very important for the Russian television audience—of Standartenführer von Stierlitz... If anyone missed the connection between Putin, who served in Germany, and von Stierlitz, articles in the press reminded them of the resemblance and helped create the association." The connection went both ways; Putin was strongly influenced by the novels, commenting: "What amazed me most of all was how one man's effort could achieve what whole armies could not."_NEWLINE_Stierlitz movies contributed a number of catchphrases, such as "Character: nordic, robust" (Характер — нордический, выдержанный, a personal characteristic, usually mocking or ironic).

 _START_ARTICLE_ Ford Taunus P3 _START_SECTION_ High profile launch _START_PARAGRAPH_ The car received its public launch at the Beethoven Hall in Bonn. Unusually for a car launch, both the by now 84-year-old German chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, and the grandson of the firm's founder, Henry Ford, were present. In addition to the latest Ford Taunus, they were celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of Ford's Cologne plant. It had been on 2 October 1930 that Henry Ford and the then mayor of nearby Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, had laid the foundation stone for the Cologne Ford Plant. _START_SECTION_ European design _START_PARAGRAPH_ The first post-war Taunus models had been designed in North America. The Taunus P3 was designed by Uwe Bahnsen, a German born designer who would dominate car design at Ford of Germany for nearly thirty years and whose subsequent designs included the 1969 Ford Capri and its successors.  Towards the end of his time in charge of design with Ford of Germany, Bahnsen also led the teams that designed the Fords Sierra and Scorpio. In the context of 1960 the Taunus P3 can nevertheless be seen as Bahnsen's most innovative design for a production car._NEWLINE_The 1960 Taunus design featured a recurring geometrical shape, which was a cross between a short sausage and a long lozenge. The rear panel and the side panels respected the same basic shape as did the front grill, subject to two large cut-outs for the headlights._NEWLINE_The same shape was carried over to the interior of the car where the main dials and controls on the dash-board were surrounded by a thick frame in the shape that respected a short sausage (or a very long lozenge). The repetitious use of a single simple shape at different levels of the design gave the overall car a consistent visual unity which was in stark contrast to the high finned flamboyance of the previous Taunus 17M and was seen at the time as a radical switch by Ford of Germany away from American styling in favour of European styling. There were no tails fins and there was very little decorative chrome included. The efficiency of its superficially much more simple design enabled Ford to boast that the 1960 car, despite being fractionally narrowed on the outside, offered usefully more interior width than the car it replaced._NEWLINE_Despite the importance of sausages in German cuisine, the award for a catchy soubriquet was earned by the person who saw the car and was reminded not of a sausage but of a bathtub. It was and remains the "Badewanne" (bathtub) soubriquet that caught the eye of the press reporters, and it is as the "Badewannetaunus" that the car continues to be remembered by enthusiasts _START_SECTION_ Technical Innovation _START_PARAGRAPH_ The P3 and the 1961 Citroën Ami were the first cars with rectangular or lozenge-shaped (non-round) headlights. This technical innovation was developed by lighting manufacturers Hella (Taunus) and Cibie (Ami). At the time, it was an unquestioned article of faith that headlights were round, and in the United States, it was the law, so these new headlights were illegal there. Ten years later this had inspired European automakers to come up with various non-round headlamp shapes, though many had by 1970 settled on a standardised shared rectangular shape. _START_SECTION_ Body _START_PARAGRAPH_ Most of the cars were sold as two- or four-door sedans/saloons. A three-door "Turnier" station wagon was also available. The confident determination of the car's designers’ to celebrate the new decade with something new and different was reflected in the unusual positioning of the rear lights on the early station wagons, on the leading edge at the back of the roof of the car, as two red horizontal units lined up directly above the tailgate. Later P3 Turniers had their rear lights more conventionally positioned._NEWLINE_The P3 also followed the tradition of its predecessor in that coach built two-door cabriolets and coupes were offered, converted by a traditional Cologne based body builder called Karl Deutsch However, these special bodied cars appear to have been relatively expensive, and only about 150 were produced._NEWLINE_The cars were offered with an unusually broad choice of color and interior trim options._NEWLINE_The early 1960s were a period of rapid expansion for the west European auto-industry, and export markets for the new 17M included Greece and Australia where several cars were converted locally into "pickups" or, in Australian English, "utes". The 17M was also assembled in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia in right hand drive. _START_SECTION_ Engine and running gear _START_PARAGRAPH_ The cars were all branded as Ford Taunus 17Ms which might have led observers who thought they had understood Ford Germany's naming conventions to conclude that the cars all came with 1.7 litre engines. In fact, there were three different engine sizes offered, being the 1498 cc unit first seen in the Taunus 15M of 1954, the 1698 cc unit originally introduced in 1957 to cope with the weight of the first Ford Taunus 17M and, from September 1961, a new larger 1757 cc engine. Power outputs initially ranged from 55 PS (40 kW; 54 hp) to 60 PS (44 kW; 59 hp), and these engine versions remained available throughout the model's four-year life, but several more powerful engines featuring raised compression ratios in response to the increased availability of higher octane fuels appeared during the four-year period: by 1964 the most powerful Ford 17M offered 75 PS (55 kW; 74 hp). In Sweden, the more powerful version first available in 1962 was sold as the "Taunus Sport", with the inclusion of a more lavish interior. Approximately 50% of the cars built were delivered with the smallest of the three engines, the 1498 cc unit._NEWLINE_The engines were all gasoline/petrol powered four-cylinder inline four-stroke water-cooled units._NEWLINE_Changing gear involved a column-mounted gear change, which by now was becoming increasingly mainstream in Germany. It was possible to specify a "Saxomat" automatic clutch with the three-speed transmission,: drivers content to accept a fully manual gear change system could also specify a four-speed gear box._NEWLINE_There were several important technical innovations during the four-year model run which no doubt go some way to explain the car's commercial success when compared to that achieved by its predecessor, and will have strengthened the Ford image in a market which had grown used to seeing Ford sales trailing those of General Motors’ Opel business.  In April 1962 the 17M became the first mainstream production car in Germany to offer, as an option, disc brakes on the front wheels. Just over a year later front disc brakes became a standard fitting on all models. 1962 was also the year when the car acquired an "automatic starter" which reportedly made the traditional manual choke unnecessary. _START_SECTION_ Optional extras _START_PARAGRAPH_ Options available at extra cost included velour carpeting, grab handles for the passengers in the back, whitewall tires, a two tone paint finish and even a "make-up mirror" cleverly incorporated into the sun-visor on the passenger's side. _START_SECTION_ Commercial _START_PARAGRAPH_ The boldly styled and regularly upgraded Taunus P3 was a commercial success. 669,731 were produced. The figure includes 86,010 station wagons. In the sales statistics for several months of 1961/62 the success of the model even enabled Ford briefly to overtake Opel on the German market, becoming the second best selling auto-brand, beaten to the top spot only by Volkswagen._NEWLINE_The Taunus P3 was replaced by the Ford Taunus P5 which would come with a wider range of engines and which would sell at approximately the same rate. However, the overall market size was growing through the 1960s, and with it grew the sales of the Opel Rekord. After the Taunus P3 no future Taunus model would come close to challenging Opel’s dominance of the large lucrative middle-market portion of the German auto-market. _START_SECTION_ Fifty years on _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Taunus P3 continues to generate enthusiasm, and most of the surviving vehicles in Germany enjoy the financial privileges and responsibilities available, in Germany, to owners of cars designated and maintained as oldtimers (the term used in Germany for a classic car)._NEWLINE_In 2006 484 Taunus P3 sedans/saloons were registered in Germany along with 21 "Turnier" station wagons. There were thought to be fewer than 10 in the USA, a relatively high content of registered and/or roadworthy vehicles in the Scandinavian countries and a handful still survive in other countries (for instance some of the countries in Eastern Europe and Latin America where it was marketed) where statistics are less readily accessible than in Germany.
 _START_ARTICLE_ Deflowering (flowers) _START_PARAGRAPH_ Deflowering is a form of pruning that consists of removing flowers before they develop. It is similar to deadheading but stricter, as deadheading refers to the removal of faded flowers. Deflowering is usually performed on fruit-forming and seed-forming shrubs and trees in their first year. The aim is to prevent the plants from spending energy and nutrients on seed development before they establish themselves. Leaving some flowers and fruits to develop may be necessary for identification purposes.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Hispanics and Latinos in Texas _START_PARAGRAPH_ Hispanic and Latino Texans are residents of the state of Texas who are of Hispanic or Latino ancestry. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 38.2% of the state's population.  Moreover, the U.S Census shows that the 2010 estimated Hispanic population in Texas was 9.7 million and increased to 11.1 million in 2017 with a calculated 18% change from the 2010 Hispanic population estimate._NEWLINE_Tejano or Texano (Spanish for "Texan") is a term used to identify a Texan of Criollo Spanish or Mexican heritage. _START_SECTION_ Origins _START_PARAGRAPH_ The first European to see Texas was Alonso Álvarez de Pineda, who led an expedition for the governor of Jamaica, Francisco de Garay, in 1520. While searching for a passage between the Gulf of Mexico and Asia, Álvarez de Pineda created the first map of the northern Gulf Coast. This map is the earliest recorded document of Texas history. Moreover, the area of present day Texas was claimed by Spain at this time._NEWLINE_Years later on June 1527, an expedition led by Pánfilo de Narváez and Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca with the purpose of reaching Florida in order to build a city, resulted in a failed mission due to harsh weather and disease. Instead, the Spanish explorers were left shipwrecked off the coast of Texas where the Spanish lived for around six years.  After the years spent living in Texas among Indigenous civilization, Narvaez and Cabeza de Baca along with some of their men, found their way back to Mexico City in 1536 and told stories about the extravagancies witnessed in the north.  Learning about this, the Spanish set out due north in 1539 with the purpose of discovering riches in places yet to be explored. One of the primary motives for the excursions was for the discovery of gold._NEWLINE_The excursion of the Spanish in 1539 into the north or what is today Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, was led by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado. On July 7, 1540, Coronado's army reached the outskirts of the rumored city of much gold, Cibola,  near upper Rio Grande where the Spanish encountered massive resistance from Puebloans. The violence between the Spanish and the Puebloans continued at Cibola until the Puebloan soldiers inhabiting Cibola were forced to leave to a village where their wives and children had moved to for shelter._NEWLINE_When the fighting settled, Coronado decided to explore the land more extendedly, which was when one of the expeditions arrived at Texas in 1541 where they encountered groups of people from the Caddo tribe, leading to more events of violence.  After all, Coronado returned to New Spain on April 1542 an informed about the cruel reality of the cities in the north that were explored, describing them as not having any gold or silver. Soon after this, the Spanish decided to remain away from the north or the present day southwest region of the United States for approximately 150 years, though expeditions led by Spaniards and not authorized by Spain did take place within those years.  Until 1688, Spain essentially remained out of Texas._NEWLINE_Around 1688, the Spanish learned about French interventions occurring in the area of Texas, land that had already been claimed by Spain. This led to the actions taken by Spaniard Alonso de León, the then governor of Coahuila, to march into Texas towards Fort St. Louis. Fort St. Louis was the location where the French were set up. On April 1689, Alonso de Leon arrived with his army ready to take down the French fort and looking for any remaining French in the area. During the time there, de Leon was informed by some of the located French that the Karankawa people had attacked them and left the fort in ruins, forcing the French to flee.  A year after going back to New Spain, de Leon returned to Texas because he was concerned about the French returning to Spanish territory. Spanish activity in Texas remained minimal and only returned when the French attempted to intervene._NEWLINE_In 1690 when de Leon returned to Texas, he had with him an army of about 100 men made up of soldiers and priests and built the first church in Texas, named San Francisco de los Tejas. The construction of this church was a major stepping stone for Spain as Spanish Texas was headed to become an area of greater importance for Spain. After San Francisco de los Tejas was established, the construction of many more missions followed, such as Mision Nuestra Senora del Rosario and Nuestra Senora del Refugio. A year later in January 1691, Domingo Terán de los Ríos was appointed to be the governor of Spanish Texas. Throughout the construction of various churches, the Spanish had interactions with different Indigenous groups. Soon enough, interracial marriages led to the development of different races such as mestizos, criollos, and culebras/mulattos. This led to the development of the Caste system in Texas and throughout the southwest United States. During this time, Spain faced problems with the French, the Natives, and with also with each other. With years passing by, the occurrence of other events such as the American Revolution in 1775, led to more problems in Texas. Soon enough, Spain would have to face the ever-growing United States and the Mexican population while having problems with the Natives and the French._NEWLINE_Mexico declared its independence from Spain on September 16, 1810 and war ended on September 26, 1821. Because of Mexico's independence from Spain, Texas became the property of Mexico. Around this time, the United States had obtained massive amounts of land from France through the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. In addition, under Mexican law, Texas was available for anyone to move to and also offered land grants to empresarios. During this time, the population of Texas grew quickly. The population was not only Mexican but also included United States citizens, Native Americans and enslaved people.  When people residing in Texas did not agree with Mexican law and did not follow the law, Mexico ended all immigration into Texas. Such events led to the Texas Independence which then led to the annexation of Texas and then to the Mexican–American War._NEWLINE_On February 2, 1848 the peace treaty, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, was signed between Mexico and the United States which essentially gave the United States much of the land that was owned by Mexico in the north and established the Rio Grande River as the border between Texas and Mexico. Moreover, Hispanics and Latinos already living in the territory that became of the United States, were given the opportunity to stay and obtain United States citizenship. While many chose to leave to their home country, many also decided to stay._NEWLINE_The major immigration of Mexicans into Texas began during the 1890s due to the growth and Industrialisation aspect of Texas that created a plethora of jobs. _START_SECTION_ Demographics _START_PARAGRAPH_ Hispanics (of any race) were 7.1% of the state population in 1910. As of 2010, 45% of Texas residents had Hispanic ancestry; these include recent immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, as well as Tejanos, whose ancestors have lived in Texas as early as the 1700s.  Tejanos are the largest ancestry group in southern Duval County and among the largest in and around Bexar County, including San Antonio, where over one million Hispanics live.  The state has the second largest Hispanic population in the United States, behind California._NEWLINE_Hispanics dominate southern, south-central, and western Texas and form a significant portion of the residents in the cities of San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, and Austin.  The Hispanic population contributes to Texas having a younger population than the American average, because Hispanic births have outnumbered non-Hispanic white births since the early 1990s.  In 2007, for the first time since the early nineteenth century, Hispanics accounted for more than half of all births (50.2%), while non-Hispanic whites accounted for just 34%._NEWLINE_Steve Murdock, a demographer with the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University and a former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, predicted that, between 2000 and 2040 (assuming that the net migration rate will equal half that of 1990-2000), Hispanic public school enrollment will increase by 213 percent, while non-Hispanic white enrollment will decrease by 15 percent. As of 2010, 29.21% (6,543,702) of Texas residents age 5 and older spoke Spanish at home as a primary language. _START_SECTION_ Spanish language in Texas _START_PARAGRAPH_ In Texas, English is the state's de facto official language (though it lacks de jure status) and is used in government. However, the continual influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants increased the import of Spanish in Texas. Texas's counties bordering Mexico are mostly Hispanic, and consequently, Spanish is commonly spoken in the region. The Government of Texas, through Section 2054.116 of the Government Code, mandates that state agencies provide information on their websites in Spanish to assist residents who have limited English proficiency. _START_SECTION_ Origins _START_PARAGRAPH_ From 1915 to 1919, during the Mexican Revolution, Mexicans and Tejanos in South Texas faced increased violence from Texan Rangers. Due to tensions caused by changes in both governments and the border, people of Latino descent were hanged, shot, burnt, decapitated, and tortured. Texas Legislative Investigation ended this period of violence by finding the Texas Rangers guilty. More recently, the Texas government has acknowledged this period of history with the "Life and Death on the Border, 1910 to 1920" exhibit._NEWLINE_Anti-Latino attitudes spiked during the Great Depression of the 1920s. Latinos, among other foreigners, were accused of stealing jobs from Americans and contributing to the decline of the economy. In response to the growing, Anglo-American, frustration, the United States government forcibly removed 2 million latinos with the majority of them being American citizens. During these repatriations, local governments denied aid to those of Mexican descent, offered train fares to Mexico and  raided Latino communities. Hospitals removed Latinos with disabilities and illness while employers laid off Latino workers. To avoid raids and discrimination, many Latinos returned to Mexico voluntarily. By 1936, approximately one third of Texas's Latino population had been repatriated._NEWLINE_These sentiments heightened in the 1840s with the end of the Mexican-American War and the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The increased population of Latinos were met with further illegal deportations, violence, racism, and segregation. In instance of these reactions was the Olivera Street raid of 1931. During this raid, law enforcement and immigration agents arrested and deported nearly 400 Mexican-Americans despite their citizenship or immigration status in America. _START_SECTION_ Mob Violence _START_PARAGRAPH_ Anti-Latino sentiments grew during the California Gold Rush as many Latinos demonstrated more advanced mining skills than their white counterparts.  From the late 19th century, the Gold Rush era, to the early 20th century, mob violence against Spanish-speaking individuals became a common occurrence and the number of victims reached well over thousands. During this period, Texas Rangers carried out lynchings of Hispanic men, women, and children for accusations that included cattle theft, murder, witchcraft, and even refusal to play the fiddle. Some case studies included the burning of Refugio Ramírez and his family for the alleged bewitching of neighbors in 1880 by a mob in Collin County, North Texas. Another event included the Porvenir Massacre of 1918, which involved the seizure and assassination of 15 men and boys from the village of Porvenir in Presidio County, Texas. Although Texas Rangers justified the murders by accusing the people of being "thieves, spies and murderers",  the United States Army's and the State Department's investigations found that the denizens of Porvenir were unarmed and innocent. As a result, Texas state government began investigation of the Texas Rangers. _START_SECTION_ Environmental Racism _START_PARAGRAPH_ With a high number of chemical industries and facilities, various neighborhoods within Houston are susceptible to toxic air pollution. The communities closest to these environmentally hazardous spaces are communities of low-income, people of color.  Located in East Houston, Harrisburg/Manchester and Galena Park are the two communities with the closest proximity to Risk Management Plan (RMP) facilities or facilities that use certain hazardous substances._NEWLINE_Both Harrisburg/Manchester and Galena Park are largely made up of impoverished, Latino communities with average household incomes of $49,732 and $45,431. Due to the close proximity to RMP facilities, the people of these neighborhoods are at a 24 to 36 percent higher risk of getting cancer when compared to the predominantly white neighborhoods of Houston.  Harrisburg/Manchester is geographically centered in the middle of "21 Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reporting facilities, 11 large quantity generators of hazardous waste, 4 facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste, 9 major dischargers of air pollutants, and 8 major stormwater discharging facilities".   An average of 484,000 pounds of toxic chemicals are released into the Harrisburg/Manchester air while none are released in communities with average household incomes of $226,333 and poverty rate of 3 percent. _START_SECTION_ School Segregation _START_PARAGRAPH_ Spanning from the 1890s to the 1980s, 122 school districts throughout 59 counties established segregated schools for Mexican-Americans. These poorly developed schools lacked the adequate schooling environment. Teachers possessed no credentials or experience while the classrooms lacked the necessary equipment. School administrators often placed Tejano students into 'low-track' classes. By assessing Tejano students on biased rubrics that evaluated mental, emotional, and language abilities, school officials classified Tejano students as inferior and underdeveloped. Beginning with elementary schools, administrators assigned Tejano children to low-level and nonacademic courses, aimed to lead the students to vocational or general-education courses. Due to unequal educational platforms, disregard for Tejano culture, and linguistic intolerance, Hispanic students had higher withdrawal rates and lower academic performances.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Rehearsal letter _START_PARAGRAPH_ A rehearsal letter is a boldface letter of the alphabet in an orchestral score, and its corresponding parts, that provides the conductor, who typically leads rehearsals, with a convenient spot to tell the orchestra to begin at places other than the start of movements or pieces. Rehearsal letters are most often used in scores of the Romantic era and onwards, beginning with Louis Spohr. Rehearsal letters are typically placed at structural points in the piece. _START_SECTION_ Terminology _START_PARAGRAPH_ They may also be generically called rehearsal marks or rehearsal figures, or, when numbers are used instead of letters, rehearsal numbers. _START_SECTION_ Purpose _START_PARAGRAPH_ In the course of rehearsing a symphony or piece, it is often necessary for the conductor to stop and go back to some point in the middle, in order to master the more difficult passages or sections, or to resolve a challenge that the ensemble is having. Many scores and parts have bar numbers, every five or ten bars, or at the beginning of each page or line. But as pieces and individual movements of works became longer (extending to several hundred bars) as the Romantic era progressed, bar numbers became less practical in rehearsal._NEWLINE_For example, a conductor can tell their musicians to resume at bar 387, so that the musicians have to find the nearest bar number in their parts (e.g. 385 or 390) and count back or forward a couple of measures. Even if the number 387 is written at the appropriate bar, it might not particularly stand out. But if there is, for example, a big, bold letter M in the score and parts, it is much easier for the conductor to just say "begin at letter M". Even if the conductor were to say "one bar before letter M", that would still be more convenient than saying "bar 386". Alternatively the conductor could first say "before M..." and allow the players time to find M and then say "one bar"._NEWLINE_In the score of a full orchestra, rehearsal letters are typically placed over the flutes' (or piccolo's) staff, and duplicated above the first violins' staff. For concert bands, rehearsal letters are placed over the piccolo's staff (or flutes'), and over the trumpets'. Rehearsal letters should appear in every part, but the conductor or librarian should check this and also make sure that they agree with the conductor's score; if they do not, the letters from the parts should be copied to the conductor's score. For typical pieces or movements of the Romantic era marked allegro, the letters A to Z can be used up, though the letters I, J or O (or all) may be skipped._NEWLINE_Placement and frequency of the letters do not follow a hard-and-fast rule. Generally they are inserted at places where there is a musically significant change, for example a new theme, or a change in dynamic or instrumentation or the start of a new section – just those places where a conductor might want to restart in rehearsal. In addition, having the letters coincide with musical signposts can help players who are counting rests confirm they are still in the right place, which would not be possible if the marks were placed at numerically regular intervals._NEWLINE_The letter A is almost always used for a point close to the beginning, but not for the very beginning itself because it is much easier to say "from the beginning". Likewise, rehearsal letters are not necessary at changes in tempo, key signature or time signature, as the name of the new tempo or signature can serve the same purpose. For example, in some editions of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, letter A of the Finale does not occur until bar 140, when the relatively late entry of the first violins with the "Ode to Joy" theme might not stand out enough to the other players to be a convenient point of reference, whereas the reminiscences of the previous movements' themes are more easily referenced by their tempo markings._NEWLINE_A rehearsal letter usually breaks a multimeasure rest in a part (except in cases where a given instrument does not play at all in a given movement of the work). Because rehearsal letters are sometimes independent of edition and in some cases even version, they are also useful for telling applicants for positions in the orchestra what passages they need to play at the audition. They are also useful for easy reference in scholarly essays about orchestral works. However, rehearsal letters are altogether absent from some editions of some pieces that have them in other editions, such as the older editions of Richard Wagner's Meistersinger prelude._NEWLINE_Rehearsal letters are less useful in unaccompanied instrumental music such as the solo piano repertoire (although they may be used in duets), since the instrumentalist has no need to communicate to a fellow player where to resume playing. Songs also tend not to use them, because it is more useful to refer to the lyrics (except in pieces where the lyrics are highly repetitive, or those with long lyric-less sections). _START_SECTION_ Usage in the late 19th century to 21st century _START_PARAGRAPH_ In some cases, A to Z might not be enough. After Z, Aa may be used, followed by Bb, and so on until Zz (though Ii, Jj and/or Oo might also be skipped). The Wilhelm Hansen edition of Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 7 in C major presents one unusual case: the letters A to Z (including both I and J, as well as O) are used up with just three more pages left in the score. For the final flute and bassoon solo, the editors use Ö (the final letter of the Finnish alphabet) as a rehearsal letter._NEWLINE_But in the case of some composers, such as Gustav Mahler and Dmitri Shostakovich, twice through the alphabet might still not be enough. For this reason, some editors prefer rehearsal numbers to rehearsal letters. Mahler's and Shostakovich's scores use rehearsal numbers rather than letters. These are typically in boldface and enclosed in a box, or less commonly, a circle. Confusingly, however, some editions enclose bar numbers in boxes, though usually not in bold. In the Schirmer edition of Roy Harris's Symphony No. 3 (in one movement), the rehearsal numbers are enclosed in circles, and they occur every ten measures, actually being the bar number divided by 10. That rehearsal numbers "are easily confused with measure numbers" is a reason sometimes given in favor of rehearsal letters._NEWLINE_Advocates of rehearsal numbers counter that even 26 letters are not enough for some scores. Whereas rehearsal letters reset to A for each movement of a multi-movement work (even for connected movements), rehearsal numbers typically run over the course of the entire work, even if the movements are not connected. For example, the rehearsal number for the last few bars of the first movement of Edward Elgar's First Symphony is 55; the first rehearsal number of the second movement is 56. There are exceptions, however. The final outburst in the first movement of Mahler's Second Symphony is rehearsal number 27. Mahler actually wanted a pause of five minutes before the next movement, so the rehearsal numbers reset to 1, ending with 15. The third movement follows after a short break, but its first rehearsal number is 28. _START_SECTION_ Jazz and pop _START_PARAGRAPH_ For jazz and pop compositions with several choruses, "many jazz composers and arrangers" use a format in which "each successive verse/chorus part of the form is assigned successive letters of the alphabet" combined with a measure number: for example, letter A for the first 8-bar phrase of the verse after the introduction, A9 for the next 8-bar phrase, A17, A25, then B, B9, B17, B25 for the chorus, etc., with the special rehearsal marking TAG for the tag ending. In jazz and pop music, the musicians frequently refer to the "A section" or the "B section" of a 32 bar song during rehearsals. In pop music, the music is commonly organized into standard sections, such as an intro, multiple verses and choruses (refrain), one or more bridges, a guitar solo (or other instrumental solos), and an outros. As such, a bandleader who wishes to start in the middle of a song will typically specify which part of this structure the band should start on (e.g., "last four bars of the bridge, going into the guitar solo" or "last verse and go to the outro").

 _START_ARTICLE_ Feudalism in England _START_SECTION_ Origins of Feudalism _START_PARAGRAPH_ The word feudal derives from an ancient Gothic source faihu signifying simply "property" which in its most basic sense was "cattle". This can be compared to the very ancient classical Latin word pecunia, which means both cattle and money. Many societies in existence today demonstrate the traditional use of cattle as financial currency, for example the Masai of Kenya and Tanzania, who pay dowries in this form._NEWLINE_Because feudalism was in its origin a Teutonic or Gothic system from northern Europe untouched by Roman civilization, it did not exist in ancient Rome, where the nearest equivalent was clientelism. No classical Latin word therefore exists to signify it, and a new Low-Latin word feodum was invented by mediaeval European scribes to use in their Latinised charters and other writings. _START_SECTION_ Classic English feudalism _START_PARAGRAPH_ Under the English feudal system, the person of the king (asserting his allodial right) was the only absolute "owner" of land. All nobles, knights and other tenants, termed vassals, merely "held" land from the king, who was thus at the top of the "feudal pyramid". When feudal land grants were of indefinite or indeterminate duration, such grants were deemed freehold, while fixed term and non-hereditable grants were deemed non-freehold. However, even freehold fiefs were not unconditionally heritable—before inheriting, the heir had to pay a suitable feudal relief._NEWLINE_Below the king in the feudal pyramid was a tenant-in-chief (generally in the form of a baron or knight) who was a vassal of the king, and holding from him in turn was a mesne tenant (generally a knight, sometimes a baron, including tenants-in-chief in their capacity as holders of other fiefs) who held when sub-enfeoffed by the tenant-in-chief. Below the mesne tenant further mesne tenants could hold from each other in series. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship. _START_SECTION_ Vassalage _START_PARAGRAPH_ Before a lord could grant land (a fief) to a tenant, he had to make that person a vassal. This was done at a formal and symbolic ceremony called a commendation ceremony composed of the two-part act of homage and oath of fealty. During homage, the lord and vassal entered a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces, a valuable right in a society without police and with only a rudimentary justice system._NEWLINE_The word fealty derives from the Latin fidelitas and denotes the fidelity owed by a vassal to his feudal lord. Fealty also refers to an oath which more explicitly reinforces the commitments of the vassal made during homage. Such an oath follows homage. Once the commendation was complete, the lord and vassal were now in a feudal relationship with agreed-upon mutual obligations to one another. The vassal's principal obligation to the lord was the performance of military service. Using whatever equipment the vassal could obtain by virtue of the revenues from the fief, the vassal was responsible to answer to calls to military service on behalf of the lord._NEWLINE_This security of military help was the primary reason the lord entered into the feudal relationship, but the vassal had another obligation to his lord, namely attendance at his court, whether manorial, baronial or at the king's court itself in the form of parliament. This involved the vassal providing "counsel", so that if the lord faced a major decision he would summon all his vassals and hold a council. On the manorial level this might be a fairly mundane matter of agricultural policy, but also included the handing down by the lord of sentences for criminal offences, including capital punishment in some cases. Concerning the king's feudal court, the prototype of parliament, such deliberation could include the question of declaring war. Depending on the period of time and location, feudal customs and practices varied, see examples of feudalism. _START_SECTION_ Varieties of feudal tenure _START_PARAGRAPH_ Under the feudal system several different forms of land tenure existed, each effectively a contract with differing rights and duties attached thereto. The main varieties are as follows:

 _START_ARTICLE_ NY Med _START_SECTION_ Critical reception _START_PARAGRAPH_ NY Med received "universal acclaim" based on an aggregate score of 84 out of 100 from six critics on Metacritic. Verne Gay of Newsday called the series "beautiful and moving," adding "NY Med brings it all home with power, beauty, insight and a degree of emotion that's an occasional sharp uppercut to the jaw." New York Magazine's Matt Zoller Seitz said the series "is filled with warm, honest moments like this — some poignant, others comic — and characters who would be plenty compelling even if they didn't keep revealing surprising new sides." Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times called the series "surprisingly addictive", adding "NY Med appears less self-conscious about its medical pedigree than its predecessors, more willing to embrace the dramatic pacing and elasticities of television." The New York Times' Mike Hale thought the series was "predictably absorbing" but added "NY Med and its predecessors have an interesting, though certainly unintentional, effect: The intense focus on the heroics of the nurses and doctors can make the patients look just as helpless and pathetic as we fear we will be when our day in the ward comes." _START_SECTION_ Patient privacy lawsuit _START_PARAGRAPH_ One episode of NY Med depicted the case of an elderly man, Mark Chanko, who arrived at NewYork–Presbyterian hospital after he was hit by a garbage truck.

The patient's family had not granted ABC or the hospital permission to film his treatment, and they were deeply upset by the episode. The family sued ABC and New York–Presbyterian Hospital for violating Mark Chanko's privacy. The case was dismissed by an appellate court. However, the family appealed and the NY judiciary felt there was sufficient reason to bring it before the state's highest appellate court. New York–Presbyterian agreed to a $2.2M settlement with the Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights, who investigated this as a HIPAA violation. ABC removed the segment from the DVD version of the episode and from future broadcasts.

The Mayfair's ownership then consisted of several investors, most of whom were Ottawa-based._NEWLINE_The Mayfair cancelled a planned showing of Videodrome in April 1983 when police threatened the theatre with obscenity charges. A handful of citizens, including Maude Barlow, objected to the violent content of the film which was approved by the Ontario Board of Censors and was previously shown without incident in Nepean, Ontario._NEWLINE_Director Michael Rubbo rented the theatre for three days in early 1986 to conduct a "four-waller" promotion for his film The Peanut Butter Solution which had fared poorly in the English Canadian market._NEWLINE_In 1986, major renovations resulted in new concession stand and box office spaces, while 492 wider seats replaced the original set of approximately 600 seats. In 1988, the Mayfair's regular admission price was $5, or $3.50 for those with theatre memberships which were available for $5 per year, or $3 per year for students. During that time, membership numbered more than 5000. _START_SECTION_ 1990s _START_PARAGRAPH_ Double features became available on all days as of 1 April 1990 as the Chinese-language films were discontinued. Sunday afternoon double features were also introduced at that time. Regular prices for the double features were $5.50, or $4 for those who obtained a $6 annual membership. Featured films were predominantly hit American productions with a minority of classic and international films._NEWLINE_Tom Bergin became manager in the early 1990s when Davidson left to pursue other interests. _START_SECTION_ 2000s _START_PARAGRAPH_ In August 2008, local media indicated that the theatre would close effective 30 November 2008, the date at which the theatre would terminate its membership programme. The City of Ottawa declared the theatre building as a heritage site under the Ontario Heritage Act on 8 October 2008, a designation which prohibits outright demolition of the building._NEWLINE_Public and community concern over the closure of the Mayfair and interest in its heritage value resulted in the formation of the Friends of the Mayfair Theatre, a loosely organized community group that claimed several hundred members._NEWLINE_In November 2008, a new partnership consisting of filmmakers Lee Demarbre and Ian Driscoll, projectionist and film conservator Paul Gordon and film scholar John Yemen announced that they had signed a ten-year lease with owner Stephen Ng. The new owners renovated the facility with new seating, some couches in the balcony, a digital video projection system, a new 16mm projector, a Dolby Digital sound system for the 35mm projectors, and a long play tower system. Seating capacity was reduced from 492 to 343. The Mayfair reopened on 2 January 2009 with the film Metropolis accompanied by short subjects from local filmmakers. The theatre's reopening was accompanied with a renewed emphasis on its repertory role. During this relaunch month, thirteen Ottawa premieres were presented while double bills were now limited to Tuesday nights and occasionally other nights. Midnight screenings on Friday and Saturday nights were also introduced._NEWLINE_In July 2009 two of the founding members of the new partnership, John Yemen and Paul Gordon left the group to pursue other projects. John Yemen was the individual who sent the city a proposal for heritage designation in the summer of 2008. The makeup of the partnership is now Lee Demarbre (programmer), Ian Driscoll, and Josh Stafford. _START_SECTION_ 2010s _START_PARAGRAPH_ Currently, the Mayfair's programming includes cult films, family matinees,independent films, Ottawa premieres, local films, festivals, and late night presentations. It also became the main venue for the Ottawa International Writers Festival in spring of 2010, hosting readings and lectures. The theatre also reports continued success with its annual Halloween screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. _START_SECTION_ Mayfair Orleans _START_PARAGRAPH_ The Mayfair opened a three-screen cinema in Orleans on 2 December 2011. It was situated at the former Empire Six theatre facility. This location presented similar programming as the original Mayfair location, with some emphasis on family-oriented films. The Mayfair Orleans location closed on 13 February 2013 when its lease was cancelled due to arrears in rent.
 _START_ARTICLE_ DC Comics _START_SECTION_ Origins _START_PARAGRAPH_ Entrepreneur Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson founded National Allied Publications in autumn 1934. The company debuted with the tabloid-sized New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1 with a cover date of February 1935. The company's second title, New Comics #1 (Dec. 1935), appeared in a size close to what would become comic books' standard during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, with slightly larger dimensions than today's. That title evolved into Adventure Comics, which continued through issue #503 in 1983, becoming one of the longest-running comic-book series. In 2009 DC revived Adventure Comics with its original numbering. In 1935, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the future creators of Superman, created Doctor Occult, who is the earliest DC Comics character to still be in the DC Universe._NEWLINE_Wheeler-Nicholson's third and final title, Detective Comics, advertised with a cover illustration dated December 1936, eventually premiered three months late with a March 1937 cover date. The themed anthology series would become a sensation with the introduction of Batman in issue #27 (May 1939). By then, however, Wheeler-Nicholson had gone. In 1937, in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor Harry Donenfeld—who also published pulp magazines and operated as a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News—Wheeler-Nicholson had to take Donenfeld on as a partner in order to publish Detective Comics #1. Detective Comics, Inc. was formed, with Wheeler-Nicholson and Jack S. Liebowitz, Donenfeld's accountant, listed as owners. Major Wheeler-Nicholson remained for a year, but cash-flow problems continued, and he was forced out. Shortly afterwards, Detective Comics, Inc. purchased the remains of National Allied, also known as Nicholson Publishing, at a bankruptcy auction._NEWLINE_Detective Comics, Inc. soon launched a fourth title, Action Comics, the premiere of which introduced Superman. Action Comics #1 (June 1938), the first comic book to feature the new character archetype—soon known as "superheroes"—proved a sales hit. The company quickly introduced such other popular characters as the Sandman and Batman._NEWLINE_On February 22, 2010, a copy of Action Comics #1 (June 1938) sold at an auction from an anonymous seller to an anonymous buyer for $1 million, besting the $317,000 record for a comic book set by a different copy, in lesser condition, the previous year. _START_SECTION_ Golden Age _START_PARAGRAPH_ National Allied Publications soon merged with Detective Comics, Inc., forming National Comics Publications on September 30, 1946. National Comics Publications absorbed an affiliated concern, Max Gaines' and Liebowitz' All-American Publications. In the same year Gaines let Liebowitz buy him out, and kept only Picture Stories from the Bible as the foundation of his own new company, EC Comics. At that point, "Liebowitz promptly orchestrated the merger of All-American and Detective Comics into National Comics... Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, [the self-distributorship] Independent News, and their affiliated firms into a single corporate entity, National Periodical Publications". National Periodical Publications became publicly traded on the stock market in 1961._NEWLINE_Despite the official names "National Comics" and "National Periodical Publications", the company began branding itself as "Superman-DC" as early as 1940, and the company became known colloquially as DC Comics for years before the official adoption of that name in 1977._NEWLINE_The company began to move aggressively against what it saw as copyright-violating imitations from other companies, such as Fox Comics' Wonder Man, which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing Fawcett Comics over Captain Marvel, at the time comics' top-selling character (see National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.). Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1953 and ceased publishing comics. Years later, Fawcett sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC—which in 1972 revived Captain Marvel in the new title Shazam! featuring artwork by his creator, C. C. Beck. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by Marvel Comics in 1967, with the creation of their Captain Marvel, forbidding the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning live action TV adaptation and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the DC Universe._NEWLINE_When the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s the company focused on such genres as science fiction, Westerns, humor, and romance. DC also published crime and horror titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles, including Action Comics and Detective Comics, the medium's two longest-running titles, continued publication. _START_SECTION_ Silver Age _START_PARAGRAPH_ In the mid-1950s, editorial director Irwin Donenfeld and publisher Liebowitz directed editor Julius Schwartz (whose roots lay in the science-fiction book market) to produce a one-shot Flash story in the try-out title Showcase. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome, penciler Carmine Infantino, and inker Joe Kubert create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash's civilian identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash's reimagining in Showcase #4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the Green Lantern character, the introduction of the modern all-star team Justice League of America (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the Silver Age of comic books._NEWLINE_National did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor Mort Weisinger, introduced such enduring characters as Supergirl, Bizarro, and Brainiac. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the "New Look", re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context._NEWLINE_Since the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company's other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC's characters inhabited a shared continuity that, decades later, was dubbed the "DC Universe" by fans. With the story "Flash of Two Worlds", in Flash #123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer Gardner Fox and artists Infantino and Joe Giella) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s Golden Age heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional "Earth 2", as opposed to the modern heroes' "Earth 1"—in the process creating the foundation for what would later be called the DC Multiverse._NEWLINE_DC's introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC's JLA as the specific spur, Marvel Comics writer-editor Stan Lee and a robust creator Jack Kirby ushered in the sub-Silver Age "Marvel Age" of comics with the debut issue of The Fantastic Four. Reportedly, DC ignored the initial success of Marvel with this editorial change until its consistently strengthening sales, albeit also benefiting Independent News' business as their distributor as well, made that impossible. That commercial situation especially applied with Marvel's superior sell-through percentage numbers which were typically 70% to DC's roughly 50%, which meant DC's publications were barely making a profit in comparison after returns from the distributors were calculated while Marvel was making an excellent profit by comparison._NEWLINE_However, the senior DC staff were reportedly at a loss at this time to understand how this small publishing house was achieving this increasingly threatening commercial strength. For instance, when Marvel's product was examined in a meeting, Marvel's emphasis on more sophisticated character-based narrative and artist-driven visual storytelling was apparently ignored for self-deluding guesses at the brand's popularity which included superficial reasons like the presence of the color red or word balloons on the cover, or that the perceived crudeness of the interior art was somehow more appealing to readers. When Lee learned about DC's subsequent experimental attempts to imitate these perceived details, he amused himself by arranging direct defiance of those assumptions in Marvel's publications as sales strengthened further to frustrate the competition._NEWLINE_However, this ignorance of Marvel's true appeal did not extend to some of the writing talent during this period, from which there were some attempts to emulate Marvel's narrative approach. For instance, there was the Doom Patrol series by Arnold Drake, a writer who previously warned the management of the new rival's strength; a superhero team of outsiders who resented their freakish powers, which Drake later speculated was plagiarized by Stan Lee to create The X-Men. There was also the young Jim Shooter who purposely emulated Marvel's writing when he wrote for DC after much study of both companies' styles, such as for the Legion of Super-Heroes feature._NEWLINE_A 1966 Batman TV show on the ABC network sparked a temporary spike in comic book sales, and a brief fad for superheroes in Saturday morning animation (Filmation created most of DC's initial cartoons) and other media. DC significantly lightened the tone of many DC comics—particularly Batman and Detective Comics—to better complement the "camp" tone of the TV series. This tone coincided with the famous "Go-Go Checks" checkerboard cover-dress which featured a black-and-white checkerboard strip (all DC books cover dated February 1966 until August 1967) at the top of each comic, a misguided attempt by then-managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC's output "stand out on the newsracks". In particular, DC artist, Carmine Infantino, complained that the visual cover distinctiveness made DC's titles easier for readers to see and then avoid in favor of Marvel's titles._NEWLINE_In 1967, Batman artist Infantino (who had designed popular Silver Age characters Batgirl and the Phantom Stranger) rose from art director to become DC's editorial director. With the growing popularity of upstart rival Marvel Comics threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with more focus towards marketing new and existing titles and characters with more adult sensibilities towards an emerging older age group of superhero comic book fans that grew out of Marvel's efforts to market their superhero line to college-aged adults. He also recruited major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko and promising newcomers Neal Adams and Denny O'Neil and replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including Joe Kubert and Dick Giordano, to give DC's output a more artistic critical eye. _START_SECTION_ Kinney National/Warner Communications subsidiary (1967-1990) _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by Kinney National Company, which purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1969. Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as National Kinney Corporation) and changed its name to Warner Communications Inc._NEWLINE_In 1970, Jack Kirby moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the Silver Age of Comics, in which Kirby's contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively The Fourth World. In the existing series Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen and in his own, newly launched series New Gods, Mister Miracle, and The Forever People, Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain Darkseid and the other-dimensional realm Apokolips. Furthermore, Kirby intended their stories to be later reprinted in collected editions in a publishing format that would later be called the trade paperback, which would become a standard industry practice decades later. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management's initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the "Fourth World" was all cancelled, although Kirby's conceptions would soon become integral to the broadening of the DC Universe. Obligated by his contract, Kirby created other unrelated series for DC, including Kamandi, The Demon, and OMAC, before ultimately returning to Marvel Comics. _START_SECTION_ The Bronze Age _START_PARAGRAPH_ Following the science-fiction innovations of the Silver Age, the comics of the 1970s and 1980s would become known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more naturalistic and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the Comics Code Authority, explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics' story "Green Goblin Reborn!" in The Amazing Spider-Man #96 (May 1971), and after the Code's updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams' Green Lantern, beginning with the story "Snowbirds Don't Fly" in the retitled Green Lantern / Green Arrow #85 (Sept. 1971), which depicted Speedy, the teen sidekick of superhero archer Green Arrow, as having become a heroin addict._NEWLINE_Jenette Kahn, a former children's magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as Firestorm and Shade, the Changing Man, as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-Wertham days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the first Superman movie, Kahn expanded the line further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five-page stories. This was a move the company called the "DC Explosion". The move was not successful, however, and corporate parent Warner dramatically cut back on these largely unsuccessful titles, firing many staffers in what industry watchers dubbed "the DC Implosion". In September 1978, the line was dramatically reduced and standard-size books returned to 17 story pages but for a still increased 40 cents. By 1980, the books returned to 50 cents with a 25-page story count but the story pages replaced house ads in the books._NEWLINE_Seeking new ways to boost market share, the new team of publisher Kahn, vice president Paul Levitz, and managing editor Giordano addressed the issue of talent instability. To that end—and following the example of Atlas/Seaboard Comics and such independent companies as Eclipse Comics—DC began to offer royalties in place of the industry-standard work-for-hire agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. As it happened, the implementation of these incentives proved opportune considering Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief, Jim Shooter, was alienating much of his company's creative staff with his authoritarian manner and major talents there went to DC like Roy Thomas, Gene Colan, Marv Wolfman, and George Perez._NEWLINE_In addition, emulating the era's new television form, the miniseries while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book limited series. This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable open-ended commitments. The first such title was World of Krypton in 1979, and its positive results lead to subsequent similar titles and later more ambitious productions like Camelot 3000 for the direct market in 1982._NEWLINE_These changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series The New Teen Titans, by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel's ensemble series X-Men, but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and Pérez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a spin-off title, Tales of the New Teen Titans, to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title. _START_SECTION_ Modern Age _START_PARAGRAPH_ This successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC's editors to seek the same for the wider DC Universe. The result, the Wolfman/Pérez 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters' complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies. A companion publication, two volumes entitled The History of the DC Universe, set out the revised history of the major DC characters. Crisis featured many key deaths that would shape the DC Universe for the following decades, and separate the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-"Crisis"._NEWLINE_Meanwhile, a parallel update had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since early 1984, the work of British writer Alan Moore had revitalized the horror series The Saga of the Swamp Thing, and soon numerous British writers, including Neil Gaiman and Grant Morrison, began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror-fantasy material led to DC in 1993 establishing the Vertigo mature-readers imprint, which did not subscribe to the Comics Code Authority._NEWLINE_Two DC limited series, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and Watchmen by Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, drew attention in the mainstream press for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero. These titles helped pave the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these series as commercially successful trade paperbacks._NEWLINE_The mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC war comics, including series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included Sgt. Rock, G.I. Combat, The Unknown Soldier, and Weird War Tales. _START_SECTION_ Time Warner/AOL Time Warner/WarnerMedia unit (1990–present) _START_PARAGRAPH_ In March 1989, Warner Communications merged with Time Inc., making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the first Tim Burton directed Batman movie was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of DC Archive Editions, collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with colour restoration by DC's long-time resident colourist, Bob LeRose. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics when individual credits were few and far between._NEWLINE_The comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues, was thought to imply that all comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC's extended storylines in which Superman was killed, Batman was crippled and superhero Green Lantern turned into the supervillain Parallax resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero's replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured "collectables" numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves._NEWLINE_DC's Piranha Press and other imprints (including the mature readers line Vertigo, and Helix, a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including trade paperback collections of individual serial comics, as well as original graphic novels._NEWLINE_One of the other imprints was Impact Comics from 1991 to 1992 in which the Archie Comics superheroes were licensed and revamped. The stories in the line were part of its own shared universe._NEWLINE_DC entered into a publishing agreement with Milestone Media that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters. Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series Static Shock. DC established Paradox Press to publish material such as the large-format Big Book of... series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel Road to Perdition. In 1998, DC purchased WildStorm Comics, Jim Lee's imprint under the Image Comics banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint – and fictional universe – with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint America's Best Comics (ABC), a series of titles created by Alan Moore, including The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Tom Strong, and Promethea. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC. _START_SECTION_ 2000s _START_PARAGRAPH_ In March 2003 DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series Elfquest, previously self-published by creators Wendy and Richard Pini under their WaRP Graphics publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, Tower Comics' series T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004 DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers 2000 AD and Humanoids. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot Johnny DC and established the CMX imprint to reprint translated manga. In 2006, CMX took over from Dark Horse Comics publication of the webcomic Megatokyo in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of Kitchen Sink Press and acquired the rights to much of the work of Will Eisner, such as his The Spirit series and his graphic novels._NEWLINE_In 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to Crisis on Infinite Earths, promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 Zero Hour event which similarly tried to ret-con the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded Batman Begins film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC's heroes, with events climaxing in the Infinite Crisis limited series. Immediately after this event, DC's ongoing series jumped forward a full year in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, 52, to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to "Superboy" (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of Jerry Siegel used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership._NEWLINE_In 2005, DC launched its "All-Star" line (evoking the title of the 1940s publication), designed to feature some of the company's best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe. The line began with All-Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder and All-Star Superman, with All-Star Wonder Woman and All-Star Batgirl announced in 2006 but neither being released nor scheduled as of the end of 2009._NEWLINE_DC licensed characters from the Archie Comics imprint Red Circle Comics by 2007. They appeared in the Red Circle line, based in the DC Universe, with a series of one-shots followed by a miniseries that lead into two ongoing titles, each lasting 10 issues. _START_SECTION_ 2010s _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 2011, DC rebooted all of its running titles following the Flashpoint storyline. The reboot called The New 52 gave new origin stories and costume designs to many of DC's characters._NEWLINE_DC licensed pulp characters including Doc Savage and the Spirit which it then used, along with some DC heroes, as part of the First Wave comics line launched in 2010 and lasting through fall 2011._NEWLINE_In May 2011, DC announced it would begin releasing digital versions of their comics on the same day as paper versions._NEWLINE_On June 1, 2011, DC announced that it would end all ongoing series set in the DC Universe in August and relaunch its comic line with 52 issue #1s, starting with Justice League on August 31 (written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee), with the rest to follow later on in September._NEWLINE_On June 4, 2013, DC unveiled two new digital comic innovations to enhance interactivity: DC² and DC² Multiverse. DC² layers dynamic artwork onto digital comic panels, adding a new level of dimension to digital storytelling, while DC² Multiverse allows readers to determine a specific story outcome by selecting individual characters, storylines and plot developments while reading the comic, meaning one digital comic has multiple outcomes. DC² will first appear in the upcoming digital-first title, Batman '66, based on the 1960s television series and DC² Multiverse will first appear in Batman: Arkham Origins, a digital-first title based on the video game of the same name._NEWLINE_In 2014, DC announced an eight-issue miniseries titled "Convergence" which began in April 2015._NEWLINE_In 2016, DC announced a line-wide relaunch titled DC Rebirth. The new line would launch with an 80-page one-shot titled DC Universe: Rebirth, written by Geoff Johns, with art from Gary Frank, Ethan Van Sciver, and more. After that, many new series would launch with a twice-monthly release schedule and new creative teams for nearly every title. The relaunch was meant to bring back the legacy and heart many felt had been missing from DC characters since the launch of the New 52. Rebirth brought huge success, both financially and critically. _START_SECTION_ Logo _START_PARAGRAPH_ DC's first logo appeared on the April 1940 issues of its titles. The letters "DC" stood for Detective Comics, the name of Batman's flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, "A DC Publication"._NEWLINE_The November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one and was the first version with a white background. The name "Superman" was added to "A DC Publication", effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as "Superman-DC"._NEWLINE_In November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo would also serve as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's mascot in the 1960s._NEWLINE_In October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favour of a simple "DC" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of Action Comics, for example, read "DC Superman". An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as anthologies like House of Mystery or team series such as Justice League of America, the title and "DC" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a bat for "House of Mystery". This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as trademarks, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding._NEWLINE_DC's "100 Page Super-Spectacular" titles and later 100-page and "Giant" issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters "DC" in a simple sans-serif typeface within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square._NEWLINE_The July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters "DC" were rendered in a block-like typeface that would remain through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters._NEWLINE_In December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words "The Line of DC Super-Stars" and the star motif that would continue in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976._NEWLINE_When Jenette Kahn became DC's publisher in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer Milton Glaser to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the "DC bullet", this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades.

 _START_ARTICLE_ Prelude in A minor, Op. 51, No. 2 (Scriabin) _START_PARAGRAPH_ Alexander Scriabin's Prelude Opus 51 No. 2 is the second of his Quatre Morceaux (Four Pieces) op. 51, published in 1906. It is notated in A minor. It is written in a 6/8 beat in 30 measures (plus upbeat) and should be expressed Lugubre (dire)._NEWLINE_This is one of several pieces Scriabin never played in public (together with the Sonata No. 6 (op. 62)). He called it "Shattered Strings" (German "Zersprungene Saiten") when Leonid Sabaneyev reminded him of the piece during a discussion about minor and major. Sabaneyev quotes him with "Oh, let's not talk about this! This is a ghastly piece! [...] I was in an appalling situation back then. This Prelude, and also the Marche funebre in the First Sonata formed in moments disheartenment... But only these two!" (referring to his allegation that he had abandoned the minor tonality a long time ago).

 _START_ARTICLE_ Lauryn Hill _START_SECTION_ 1975–1993: Early life and career beginnings _START_PARAGRAPH_ Lauryn Noelle Hill was born on May 26, 1975 in East Orange, New Jersey. Her mother, Valerie Hill was an English teacher and her father Mal Hill a computer and management consultant. She has one older brother named Malaney who was born in 1972. Her Baptist family moved to New York and Newark for short periods before settling in South Orange, New Jersey._NEWLINE_Hill has said of her musically oriented family: "there were so many records, so much music constantly being played. My mother played the piano, my father sang, and we were always surrounded by music." Her father sang in local nightclubs and at weddings. While growing up, Hill frequently listened to Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, and Gladys Knight; years later she recalled playing Marvin Gaye's What's Going On repeatedly until she fell asleep to it._NEWLINE_In middle school, Lauryn Hill performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" before a basketball game. Due to its popularity, subsequent games featured a recording of her rendition. In 1988, Hill appeared as an Amateur Night contestant on It's Showtime at the Apollo. She sang her version of the Smokey Robinson track "Who's Lovin' You", garnering an initially harsh reaction from the crowd. She persevered through the performance, however, she later cried off-stage._NEWLINE_Hill attended Columbia High School, where she was a member of the track team, cheerleading squad and was a classmate of actor Zach Braff. She also took violin lessons, went to dance class, and founded the school's gospel choir. Academically, she took advanced placement classes and received primarily 'A' grades. School officials recognized her as a leader among the student body. Later recalling her education, Hill commented, "I had a love for—I don't know if it was necessarily for academics, more than it just was for achieving, period. If it was academics, if it was sports, if it was music, if it was dance, whatever it was, I was always driven to do a lot in whatever field or whatever area I was focusing on at the moment."_NEWLINE_While a freshman in high school, through mutual friends, Prakazrel "Pras" Michel approached Hill about a music group he was creating. Hill and Pras began under the name Translator Crew. They came up with this name because they wanted to rhyme in different languages. Another female vocalist was soon replaced by Michel's cousin, multi-instrumentalist Wyclef Jean. The group began performing in local showcases and high school talent shows. Hill was initially only a singer, but then learned to rap too; instead of modeling herself on female rappers like Salt-N-Pepa and MC Lyte, she preferred male rappers like Ice Cube and developed her flow from listening to them. Hill later said, "I remember doing my homework in the bathroom stalls of hip-hop clubs."_NEWLINE_While growing up, Hill took acting lessons in Manhattan. She began her acting career in 1991 appearing with Jean in Club XII, MC Lyte's Off-Broadway hip-hop rendering of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. While the play was not a success, an agent noticed her. Later that year, Hill began appearing on the soap opera As the World Turns in a recurring role as troubled teenager Kira Johnson. She subsequently co-starred alongside Whoopi Goldberg in the 1993 release Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, playing Rita Louise Watson, an inner-city Catholic school teenager with a surly, rebellious attitude. In it, she performed the songs "His Eye Is on the Sparrow" (a duet with Tanya Blount) and "Joyful, Joyful". Director Bill Duke credited Hill with improvising a rap in a scene: "None of that was scripted. That was all Lauryn. She was amazing." Critic Roger Ebert called her "the girl with the big joyful voice", although he thought her talent was wasted, while Rolling Stone said she "performed marvelously against type ... in the otherwise perfunctory [film]." Hill also appeared in Steven Soderbergh's 1993 motion picture King of the Hill, in a minor but pivotal role as a 1930s gum-popping elevator operator. Soderbergh biographer Jason Wood described her as supplying one of the warmest scenes in the film. Hill graduated from Columbia High School in 1993. _START_SECTION_ 1994–1996: The Fugees _START_PARAGRAPH_ Pras, Hill and Jean renamed their group the Fugees, a derivative of the word "refugee", which was a derogatory term for Haitian Americans. Hill began a romantic relationship with Jean. The Fugees, who signed a contract with Columbia/Ruffhouse Records in 1993, became known for their genre blending, particularly of reggae, rock and soul, which was first experimented on their debut album, Blunted on Reality, released in 1994. It reached number 62 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart but overall sold poorly and was met by poor critical reviews due to their management's attempt insistence they adopt gangsta rap attitudes. Although the album made little impact, Hill's rapping on "Some Seek Stardom" was seen as a highlight. Within the group, she was frequently referred to by the nickname "L. Boogie". Hill's image and artistry, as well as her full, rich, raspy alto voice, placed her at the forefront of the band, with some fans urging her to begin a solo career._NEWLINE_The Fugees' second album, The Score (1996), peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and stayed in the top ten of that chart for over half a year. It sold about six million copies in the United States and more than 17 million copies worldwide. In the 1996 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll, The Score came second in the list of best albums and three of its tracks placed within the top twenty best singles. It won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and was later included on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Almost all of the writing and producing for it was done by Jean. The Score garnered praise for being a strong alternative to the gangsta idiom, and Hill stated, "We're trying to do something positive with the music because it seems like only the negative is rising to the top these days. It only takes a drop of purity to clean a cesspool."_NEWLINE_Singles from The Score included "Fu-Gee-La" and "Ready or Not", which highlighted Hill's singing and rapping abilities, and "No Woman, No Cry". Her rendition of "Killing Me Softly" became her breakout hit. Buttressed by what Rolling Stone publications later called Hill's "evocative" vocal line and her "amazing pipes", the track became pervasive on pop, R&B, hip hop, and adult contemporary radio formats. It won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. On the album, Hill combined African-American music and Caribbean music influences with socially conscious lyrics. Newsweek mentioned Hill's "irresistibly cute looks" and proclaimed her "the most powerful new voice in rap."_NEWLINE_At 21 years old, the now-famous Hill was still living at home with her parents. She had been enrolled at Columbia University during this period, and considered majoring in history as she became a sophomore, but left after about a year of total studies once sales of The Score went into the millions. In 1996, Hill responded to a false rumor on The Howard Stern Show that she had made a racist comment on MTV, saying "How can I possibly be a racist? My music is universal. And I believe in God. If I believe in God, then I have to love all of God's creations. There can be no segregation."_NEWLINE_In 1996, Hill founded the Refugee Project, a non-profit outreach organization that sought to transform the attitudes and behavior of at-risk urban youth. Part of this was Camp Hill, which offered stays in the Catskill Mountains for such youngsters; another was production of an annual Halloween haunted house in East Orange. Hill also raised money for Haitian refugees, supported clean water well-building projects in Kenya and Uganda, and staged a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration. A 1997 benefit event for the Refugee Project introduced a Board of Trustees for the organization that included Sean Combs, Mariah Carey, Busta Rhymes, Spike Lee, and others as members._NEWLINE_In 1997, the Fugees split to work on solo projects, which Jean later blamed on his tumultuous relationship with Hill and the fact he married his wife Claudinette while still involved with Hill. Meanwhile, in the summer of 1996 Hill had met Rohan Marley, a son of Bob Marley and a former University of Miami football player. Hill subsequently began a relationship with him, while still also involved with Jean. Hill became pregnant in late 1996, and on August 3, 1997, Marley and Hill's first child, Zion David, was born. The couple lived in Hill's childhood house in South Orange after she bought her parents a new house down the street._NEWLINE_Hill had a cameo appearance in the 1997 film Hav Plenty. In 1998, Hill took up another small, but important role in the film Restaurant; Entertainment Weekly praised her portrayal of the protagonist's pregnant former girlfriend as bringing vigor to the film. _START_SECTION_ 1997–1999: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill _START_PARAGRAPH_ Hill recorded her solo record The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill from late 1997 through June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Jamaica. The title was inspired by the book The Mis-Education of the Negro (1933) by Carter G. Woodson and The Education of Sonny Carson, a film and autobiographical novel. The album featured contributions from D'Angelo, Carlos Santana, Mary J. Blige and the then-unknown John Legend. Wyclef Jean initially did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered his production help; Hill turned him down. Several songs on the album concerned her frustration with the Fugees; "I Used to Love Him" dealt with the breakdown of the relationship between Hill and Wyclef Jean. Other songs such as "To Zion" spoke about her decision to have her first baby, even though many at the time encouraged her to have an abortion so to not interfere with her blossoming career. Indeed, Hill's pregnancy revived her from a period of writer's block._NEWLINE_In terms of production, Hill collaborated with a group of musicians known as New Ark, consisting of Vada Nobles, Rasheem Pugh, Tejumold Newton, and Johari Newton. Hill later said that she wanted to "write songs that lyrically move me and have the integrity of reggae and the knock of hip-hop and the instrumentation of classic soul" and that the production on the album was intended to make the music sound raw and not computer-aided. Hill spoke of pressure from her label to emulate Prince, wherein all tracks would be credited as written and produced by the artist with little outside help. She also wanted to be appreciated as an auteur as much as Jean had within the Fugees. (She also saw a feminist cause: "But step out and try and control things and there are doubts. This is a very sexist industry. They'll never throw the 'genius' title to a sister.") While recording the album, when Hill was asked about providing contracts or documentation to the musicians, she replied, "We all love each other. This ain't about documents. This is blessed."_NEWLINE_Released on August 25, 1998, the album received rave reviews from contemporary music critics, and was the most acclaimed album of 1998. Critics lauded the album's blending of the R&B, doo-wop, pop, hip-hop, and reggae genres and its honest representation of a woman's life and relationships. David Browne, writing in Entertainment Weekly, called it "an album of often-astonishing power, strength, and feeling", and praised Hill for "easily flowing from singing to rapping, evoking the past while forging a future of her own". Robert Christgau quipped, "PC record of the year—songs soft, singing ordinary, rapping skilled, rhymes up and down, skits de trop, production subtle and terrific". In 2017 NPR rated the album as the 2nd best album of all time created by a woman._NEWLINE_It sold over 423,000 copies in its first week (boosted by advance radio play of two non-label-sanctioned singles, "Lost Ones" and "Can't Take My Eyes Off You") and topped the Billboard 200 for four weeks and the Billboard R&B Albums chart for six weeks. It went on to sell about 8 million copies in the U.S. and 12 million copies worldwide. During 1998 and 1999, Hill earned $25 million from record sales and touring. Hill, along with Blige, Missy Elliott, Meshell Ndegeocello, Erykah Badu, and others, found a voice with the neo soul genre._NEWLINE_The first single released from the album was "Lost Ones", which reached number 27 in Spring 1998. The second was "Doo Wop (That Thing)", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It exemplified Hill's appeal, combining feelings of self-empowerment with self-defense. Other charted singles from the album were "Ex-Factor", which has been interpolated by Drake and Cardi B, "Everything Is Everything" and "To Zion". In the 1998 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll, Miseducation came second in the list of best albums and "Doo Wop (That Thing)" second in best singles._NEWLINE_In November 1998, Marley and Hill's second child, Selah Louise, was born. Of being a young mother of two, Hill said, "It's not an easy situation at all. You have to really pray and be honest with yourself."_NEWLINE_In the run-up to the 1999 Grammy Awards, Hill became the first woman to be nominated in ten categories in a single year. In addition to Miseducation works, the nominations included her rendition of "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" for the 1997 film Conspiracy Theory, which had appeared on Billboard charts, and Hill's writing and producing of "A Rose Is Still a Rose", which became a late-in-career hit for Aretha Franklin. She appeared on several magazine covers, including Time, Esquire, Rolling Stone, Teen People, and The New York Times Fashion Magazine. During the ceremony, Hill broke another record by becoming the first woman to win five times in one night, taking home the awards for Album of the Year, Best R&B Album, Best R&B Song, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best New Artist. During an acceptance speech, she said, "This is crazy. This is hip-hop!" Hill had brought forth a new, mainstream acceptance of the genre._NEWLINE_In February 1999, Hill received four awards at the 30th Annual NAACP Image Awards. In May 1999, she became the youngest woman ever named to Ebony magazine's 100+ Most Influential Black Americans list; in November of that year, the same publication named her as one of "10 For Tomorrow" in the "Ebony 2000: Special Millennium Issue". In May 1999, she made People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People list. The publication, which has called her "model-gorgeous", praised the 5-foot-4-inch (1.63 m) Hill for her idiosyncratic sense of personal style. In June 1999, she received an Essence Award, but her acceptance speech, where she said there was no contradiction in religious love and servitude and "[being] who you are, as fly and as hot and as whatever," drew reaction from those in the public who thought she was not a good role model as a young, unwed mother of two. This was a repetition of criticism she had received after the birth of her first child, and she had said that she and Marley would soon be married. In early 2000, Hill was one of many artists and producers to share the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Santana's 1999 multi-million-selling Supernatural, for which she had written, produced, and rapped on the track "Do You Like the Way" (a rumination on the direction the world was headed, it also featured the singing of CeeLo Green and the signature guitar runs of Carlos Santana). She was also nominated for Best R&B Song for "All That I Can Say", which she had written and produced for Mary J. Blige. Also, her concocted duet with Bob Marley on "Turn Your Lights Down Low" for the 1999 remix tribute album Chant Down Babylon additionally appeared in the 1999 film The Best Man and later received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals._NEWLINE_In November 1998, New Ark filed a fifty-page lawsuit against Hill, her management, and record label, claiming that Hill "used their songs and production skills, but failed to properly credit them for the work" on Miseducation. The musicians claimed to be the primary songwriters on two tracks, and major contributors on several others, though Gordon Williams, a prominent recorder, engineer, and mixer on Miseducation, described the album as a "powerfully personal effort by Hill" and said "It was definitely her vision." Hill responded that New Ark had been appropriately credited and now were seeking to take advantage of her success. New Ark requested partial writing credits on most of the tracks on the album as well as monetary reimbursement. After many delays, depositions took place during the latter part of 2000. In part, the case illustrated the difficult boundaries between songwriting and all other aspects that went into contemporary arranging, sampling, and recording. The suit would eventually be settled out of court in February 2001, with Hill paying New Ark a reported $5 million. A friend of Hill's later said of the suit, "That was the beginning of a chain effect that would turn everything a little crazy." _START_SECTION_ 2000–2003: Self-imposed exile and MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 _START_PARAGRAPH_ Hill began writing a screenplay about the life of Bob Marley, in which she planned to act as his wife Rita. She also began producing a romantic comedy about soul food with a working title of Sauce, and accepted a starring role in the film adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel Beloved; she later dropped out of both projects due to pregnancy. She also reportedly turned down roles in Charlie's Angels (the part that went to Lucy Liu), The Bourne Identity, The Mexican, The Matrix Reloaded, and The Matrix Revolutions._NEWLINE_During 2000, Hill dropped out of the public eye. The pressures of fame began to overwhelm her. She disliked not being able to go out of her house to do simple errands without having to worry about her physical appearance. She fired her management team and began attending Bible study classes five days a week; she also stopped doing interviews, watching television and listening to music. She started associating with a "spiritual advisor" named Brother Anthony. Some familiar with Hill believe Anthony more resembled a cult leader than a spiritual advisor, and thought his guidance probably inspired much of Hill's more controversial public behavior._NEWLINE_She later described this period of her life to Essence saying "People need to understand that the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time … I had to step away when I realized that for the sake of the machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that."_NEWLINE_In July 2001, while pregnant with her third child, Hill unveiled her new material to a small crowd, for a taping of an MTV Unplugged special. An album of the concert, titled MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, was released in May 2002 and featured only her singing and playing an acoustic guitar. Unlike the near-unanimous praise of Miseducation, 2.0 sharply divided critics. AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying that the recording "is the unfinished, unflinching presentation of ideas and of a person. It may not be a proper follow-up to her first album, but it is fascinating." Rolling Stone called the album "a public breakdown" and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album's title opened Hill up for jokes that she had become unhinged. NME wrote that "Unplugged 2.0 is a sparse and often gruelling listen, but there is enough genius shading these rough sketches to suggest that all might not yet be lost." With the mixed reviews and no significant radio airplay, 2.0 debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. The album has been certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA._NEWLINE_Her song "Mystery of Iniquity" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rap Solo Performance and used as an interpolation by hip-hop producer/songwriter Kanye West for his single "All Falls Down", which was co-written with Lauryn Hill, as sung by Syleena Johnson._NEWLINE_Around 2001, Marley and Hill's third child, Joshua Omaru, was born. He was followed a year later by their fourth, John Nesta. While Hill sometimes had spoken of Marley as her husband, they never married, and along the way she was informed that Marley had been previously married at a young age. Furthermore, according to a 2003 Rolling Stone report, he had never secured a divorce; but Marley later disputed this and made public to a blog a 1996 divorce document from Haiti. The two had been living in a high-end Miami hotel, but around 2003 she moved out into her own place in that city. Hill later said that she and Marley "have had long periods of separation over the years". Hill slowly worked on a new album and it was reported that by 2003, Columbia Records had spent more than $2.5 million funding it, including installing a recording studio in the singer's Miami apartment and flying different musicians around the country._NEWLINE_By 2002, Hill had shut down her non-profit Refugee Project. She said, "I had a nonprofit organization and I had to shut all that down. You know, smiling with big checks, obligatory things, not having things come from a place of passion. That's slavery. Everything we do should be a result of our gratitude for what God has done for us. It should be passionate."_NEWLINE_In December 2003, Hill, during a performance in Vatican City, spoke of the "corruption, exploitation, and abuses" in reference to the molestation of boys by Catholic priests in the United States and the cover-up of offenses by Catholic Church officials. High-ranking church officials were in attendance, but Pope John Paul II was not present. The Catholic League called Hill "pathologically miserable" and claimed her career was "in decline". The following day, several reporters suggested that Hill's comments at the Vatican may have been influenced by her spiritual advisor, Brother Anthony. _START_SECTION_ 2004–2009: Sporadic touring and recording _START_PARAGRAPH_ In 2004, Hill contributed a new song, "The Passion", to The Passion of the Christ: Songs. A remix version with John Legend of his "So High" ended up receiving a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Around this time, Hill began selling a pay-per-view music video of the song "Social Drugs" through her website. Those who purchase the $15 video would only be able to view it three times before it expired. In addition to the video, Hill began selling autographed posters and Polaroids through her website, with some items listed at upwards of $500._NEWLINE_For the first time since 1997, the Fugees performed in September 2004 at Dave Chappelle's Block Party in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The concert featured Hill's nearly a cappella rendition of "Killing Me Softly". The event was recorded by director Michel Gondry and was released on March 3, 2006, to universal acclaim. The Fugees also appeared at BET Awards 2005 during June 2005, where they opened the show with a 12-minute set. One track, "Take It Easy", was leaked online and thereafter was released as an Internet single in late September. It peaked at number forty on the Billboard R&B Chart. In 2005, she told USA Today, "If I make music now, it will only be to provide information to my own children. If other people benefit from it, then so be it." When asked how she now felt about the songs on 2.0, she stated "a lot of the songs were transitional. The music was about how I was feeling at the time, even though I was documenting my distress as well as my bursts of joy."_NEWLINE_The Fugees embarked on a European tour in late 2005. Old tensions between Hill and the other members of the group soon resurfaced, and the reunion ended before an album could be recorded; Jean and Michel both blamed Hill for the split. Hill reportedly demanded to be addressed by everyone, including her bandmates, as "Ms. Hill"; she also considered changing her moniker to "Empress". Hill's tardiness was also cited as a contributing factor._NEWLINE_Hill began touring on her own, although to mixed reviews; often arriving late to concerts (sometimes by over two hours), performing unpopular reconfigurations of her songs and sporting an exaggerated appearance. On some occasions, fans have booed her and left early. In June 2007, Sony Records said Hill had been recording through the past decade, had accumulated considerable unreleased material and had re-entered the studio with the goal of making a new album. Later that same year, an album titled Ms. Hill, which featured cuts from Miseducation, various soundtracks contributions and other "unreleased" songs, was released. It features guest appearances from D'Angelo, Rah Digga and John Forté. Also in June 2007, Hill released a new song, "Lose Myself", on the soundtrack to the film Surf's Up._NEWLINE_In early 2008, Marley and Hill's fifth child, Sarah, was born. The couple were not living together, although Marley considered them "spiritually together" even while listing himself as single on social media. Hill later said that she and Marley "have [had] a long and complex history about which many inaccuracies have been reported since the beginning" and that they both valued their privacy. By August 2008, Hill was living with her mother and children in her hometown of South Orange, New Jersey._NEWLINE_Reports in mid-2008 claimed that Columbia Records then believed Hill to be on hiatus. Marley disputed these claims, telling an interviewer that Hill has enough material for several albums: "She writes music in the bathroom, on toilet paper, on the wall. She writes it in the mirror if the mirror smokes up. She writes constantly. This woman does not sleep". One of the few public appearances Hill made in 2008 was at a Martha Stewart book-signing in New Jersey, perplexing some in the press. In April 2009, it was reported that Hill would engage in a 10-day tour of European summer festivals during mid-July of that year. She performed two shows for the tour and passed out on stage during the start of her second performance and left the stage. She refused to give refunds to angry consumers for the show. On June 10, Hill's management informed the promoters of the Stockholm Jazz Festival, which she was scheduled to headline, that she would not be performing due to unspecified "health reasons." Shortly afterward, the rest of the tour was canceled as well. _START_SECTION_ 2010–present: Further activities and imprisonment _START_PARAGRAPH_ In January 2010, Hill returned to the live stage and performed in stops across New Zealand and Australia on the Raggamuffin Music Festival. Many of the songs that Hill had performed and recorded over the past six years were included on an April 2010 unofficial compilation album titled Khulami Phase. The album also features a range of other material found on the Ms. Hill compilation. Hill appeared at the Harmony Festival in Santa Rosa, California, in June 2010, her first live American performance in several years. An unreleased song called "Repercussions" was leaked via the Internet in late July 2010, debuting at number 94 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (and peaked at number 83 the following week), making it her first Billboard chart appearance as a lead artist since 1999._NEWLINE_Hill joined the Rock the Bells hip-hop festival series in the U.S. during August 2010, and as part of that year's theme of rendering classic albums, she performed The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in its entirety for the first time. She increased the tempo and urgency from the original recording, but at times had difficulty in communicating with her band. Hill continued touring, including a set at the 6th Annual Jazz in the Gardens, in Miami Gardens, Florida in December. In Spring 2011, Hill performed at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, and at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. In July 2011, Hill gave birth to her sixth child, Micah, her first not with Rohan Marley; the father remains publicly unknown._NEWLINE_In February 2012, Hill performed a new song titled "Fearless Vampire Killer", during a sold-out performance at the Warner Theater in Washington, D.C. In late 2012, Hill toured with rapper Nas; her portion of the tour, titled Black Rage, is named after her song, released October 30. Hill has described the song as being "about the derivative effects of racial inequity and abuse" and "a juxtaposition to the statement 'life is good,' which she believes can only be so when these long standing issues are addressed and resolved."_NEWLINE_In June 2012, Hill was charged with three counts of tax fraud or failing to file taxes (Title 26 USC § 7202 Willful failure to collect or pay over tax) not tax evasion on $1.8 million of income earned between 2005 and 2007. During this time she had toured as a musical artist, earned royalties from both her records and from films she had appeared in, and had owned and been in charge of multiple corporations. In a long post to her Tumblr, Hill said that she had gone "underground" and had rejected pop culture's "climate of hostility, false entitlement, manipulation, racial prejudice, sexism and ageism." She added that, "When I was working consistently without being affected by the interferences mentioned above, I filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family." On June 29, 2012, Hill appeared in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in Newark and pleaded guilty to the charges; her attorney said she would make restitution for the back taxes she owed. By April 22, 2013, Hill had paid back only $50,000 of the $554,000 she owed immediately; U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo criticized Hill, saying "This is not someone who stands before the court penniless. This is a criminal matter. Actions speak louder than words, and there has been no effort here to pay these taxes." Hill also faced possible eviction from her rented home in South Orange as well as a civil lawsuit from the town for running a business out of a home without a zoning permit._NEWLINE_On May 4, 2013, Hill released her first official single in over a decade, "Neurotic Society (Compulsory Mix)". She later published a message on her Tumblr describing how she was "required to release [it] immediately, by virtue of the impending legal deadline." The release received some criticism for lyrics that appeared to tie societal decay to certain LGBT social movements. Hill responded that the song was not targeted at any particular group but was instead focused on anyone hiding behind neurotic behavior. Following a deal with Sony Music, which involves Hill creating a new record label within the company, Hill was said to be scheduled to release her first album in fifteen years during 2013._NEWLINE_On May 6, 2013, Hill was sentenced by Judge Arleo to serve three months in prison for failing to file taxes/tax fraud and three months' house arrest afterwards as part of a year of supervised probation. She had faced a possible sentence of as long as 36 months, and the sentence given took into account her lack of a prior criminal record and her six minor-aged children. By this point Hill had fully paid back $970,000 in back taxes and penalties she owed, which also took into account an additional $500,000 that Hill had in unreported income for 2008 and 2009. In the courtroom, Hill said that she had lived "very modestly" considering how much money she had made for others, and that "I am a child of former slaves who had a system imposed on them. I had an economic system imposed on me." Hill reported to the minimum-security Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury on July 8, 2013, to begin serving her sentence._NEWLINE_Hill was released from prison on October 4, 2013, a few days early for good behavior, and began her home confinement and probationary periods. She put out a single called "Consumerism" that she had finished, via verbal and e-mailed instructions, while incarcerated. Judge Arleo allowed her to postpone part of her confinement in order to tour in late 2013 under strict conditions._NEWLINE_During 2014, Hill was heard as the narrator of Concerning Violence, an award-winning Swedish documentary on the African liberation struggles of the 1960s and 1970s. She also continued to draw media attention for her erratic behavior, appearing late twice in the same day for sets at Voodoo Fest in November 2014._NEWLINE_In May 2015, Hill canceled her scheduled concert outside Tel Aviv in Israel following a social media campaign from activists promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. She said she had wanted to also perform a show in Ramallah in the West Bank but logistical problems had proved too great. Hill stated: "It is very important to me that my presence or message not be misconstrued, or a source of alienation to either my Israeli or my Palestinian fans."_NEWLINE_Hill contributed her voice to the soundtrack for What Happened, Miss Simone?, a 2015 documentary about the life of Nina Simone, an American singer, pianist, and civil rights activist. Hill was originally supposed to record only two songs for the record, but ended up recording six. She also served as a producer on the compilation alongside Robert Glasper. Hill said of her connection to Simone: "Because I fed on this music ... I believed I always had a right to have a voice. Her example is clearly a form of sustenance to a generation needing to find theirs. What a gift." NPR critically praised Hill's performance on the soundtrack, stating: "This album mainly showcases Lauryn Hill's breadth and dexterity. Not formally marketed as Hill's comeback album, her six tracks here make this her most comprehensive set of studio recordings since The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1998."_NEWLINE_In April 2016, Hill hosted and headlined what was billed as the inaugural Diaspora Calling! festival at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn. The festival's purpose was to showcase the efforts of musicians and artists from around the African diaspora like Brooklyn Haitian Rara band Brother High Full tempo. The following month, Hill was approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes late for her show at the Chastain Park Amphitheatre in Atlanta, though members of Hill's team claimed it was only an hour after their scheduled start time. Moments after the less-than-40-minute show ended due to the venue's strict 11:00 p.m. closing time, Hill said her driver had gotten lost and she could not help that. Less than 48 hours later, after a large backlash from her fans on Twitter, she took to her Facebook page and stated she was late for the concert because of certain needs, including her need to "align her energy with the time." _START_SECTION_ Legacy and sampling _START_PARAGRAPH_ Lauryn Hill's work continues to inspire rappers and can still be heard sampled in Hip Hop today. In 2018, Hill was sampled on Cardi B's "Be Careful", Drake's "Nice for What", and A$AP Rocky's "Purity". Kanye West has mentioned Lauryn Hill in a couple of his songs. In Kanye West's song "Champion", released in 2007, he says "Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion, I wish her heart still was in rhymin". Zion is Hill's son first born, who she sings about in "To Zion" Kanye also talks about Hill in his song released in 2016, "No More parties in LA". He states "I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired" This is referring to Hill not releasing any new music since 2013._NEWLINE_Other samples of Lauryn Hill's work come from artists such as J Cole, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, and Kanye West.  J Cole samples Hill's "Nothing Even Matters" and "To Zion" in his song "Cole Summer".  A Boogie samples a few Hill songs including "Ex-Factor" in his song of the same name as well as in a remix of Drake's "Nice for What".  Kanye famously samples Hill in "All Falls Down" where he samples "Mystery of Iniquity".

In 1915, he enrolled at St. Mary's College, a preparatory school run by the Redemptorists in North East, Pennsylvania. He then studied at Mount St. Alphonsus Seminary at Esopus from 1922 to 1928.

He then served as professor of canon law at Mount St. Alphonsus Seminary until 1940, when he returned to Puerto Rico. He served as a pastor in Aguadilla (1940–45) and then in Mayagüez (1945–47). _START_SECTION_ Ponce _START_PARAGRAPH_ On May 10, 1947, McManus was appointed Bishop of Ponce by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 1 from Bishop William Tibertus McCarty, with Bishops Aloysius Joseph Willinger and William David O'Brien serving as co-consecrators, at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Brooklyn. His biggest contribution as Bishop of Ponce was the founding of the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico in 1948. He also oversaw the move of a seminary from the Archdiocese of San Juan to his diocese in Aibonito._NEWLINE_During his tenure in Ponce, McManus became an outspoken critic of Luis Muñoz Marín, who served as Governor of Puerto Rico from 1949 to 1965. In the 1952 and 1956 elections, he opposed Muñoz Marín and supported the Republican Statehood Party, which demanded statehood for the island and proposed an economic plan similar to that of the continental Republican Party. In 1958, he feuded with Muñoz Marín over his program to crack down on gambling, including bingo games for the support of parish churches. He denounced the legalization of birth control measures and a law that would divorce couples who had been separated for more than three years. He also opposed the administration's measure to cut the tax-exempt donations to charity by corporations from 15% of gross income to 5% of surplus._NEWLINE_In 1960, after the Legislative Assembly failed to pass a law allowing religious instruction for schoolchildren, McManus said that the administration of Muñoz Marín was "responsible for the moral evils that cloud and de-Christianize our society." In August of that year, he helped organize the Christian Action Party, which he urged all Catholics to support. The party nominated Salvador Perea, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University, as its candidate for governor, but was caught in a controversy over the validity of the signatures it collected to get on the ballot._NEWLINE_A month before the election, McManus and two other bishops issued a pastoral letter that prohibited Catholics from voting for Muñoz Marín's Popular Democratic Party, which they claimed "accepts as its own the morality of a 'regime of license,' denying Christian morality..." The letter also stated, "It is evident that the philosophy of the Popular Democratic Party is anti-Christian and anti-Catholic, and that it is based on the modern heresy that popular will and not divine law decides what is moral and immoral. This philosophy destroys the Ten Commandments of God and permits that they be substituted by popular and human criteria." McManus insisted that Catholics who disobeyed the injunction by voting for the Popular Democrats would commit a sin. The letter resulted in widespread protests in Puerto Rico and sparked open controversy within the Church. Cardinal Francis Spellman of New York declared that Puerto Rican voters would not be penalized by the Church while Archbishop James P. Davis of San Juan defended the bishops. Muñoz Marín denounced the letter as an "incredible medieval interference in a political campaign."_NEWLINE_Between 1962 and 1965, McManus attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. _START_SECTION_ New York _START_PARAGRAPH_ McManus resigned as Bishop of Ponce for reasons of health on November 18, 1963.

As an auxiliary bishop, he served as pastor of St. Cecilia's Church in Manhattan (1964–66) and episcopal vicar of Sullivan and Ulster Counties, a post which he held until his retirement in 1970._NEWLINE_McManus died at the Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey, at age 75.
