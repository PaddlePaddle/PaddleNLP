@dataclass
class KTOConfig(TrainingArguments):
    r"""
    KTOConfig collects all training arguments related to the [`KTOTrainer`] class.

    Using [`HfArgumentParser`] we can turn this class into
    [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse#module-argparse) arguments that can be specified on the
    command line.

    Parameters:
        max_length (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The maximum length of the sequences in the batch. This argument is required if you want to use the default data collator.
        max_prompt_length (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The maximum length of the prompt. This argument is required if you want to use the default data collator.
        max_completion_length (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The maximum length of the target. This argument is required if you want to use the default data collator and your model is an encoder-decoder.
        beta (`float`, defaults to 0.1):
            The beta factor in KTO loss. Higher beta means less divergence from the initial policy.
        desirable_weight (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            The desirable losses are weighed by this factor to counter unequal number of desirable and undesirable paris.
        undesirable_weight (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            The undesirable losses are weighed by this factor to counter unequal number of desirable and undesirable pairs.
        label_pad_token_id (`int`, defaults to `-100`):
            The label pad token id. This argument is required if you want to use the default data collator.
        padding_value (`int`, defaults to `0`):
            The padding value if it is different to the tokenizer's pad_token_id.
        truncation_mode (`str`, defaults to `keep_end`):
            The truncation mode to use, either `keep_end` or `keep_start`. This argument is required if you want to use the default data collator.
        generate_during_eval (`bool`, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to sample and log generations during evaluation step.
        is_encoder_decoder (`Optional[bool]`, `optional`, defaults to `None`):
            If no model is provided, we need to know if the model_init returns an encoder-decoder.
        precompute_ref_log_probs (`bool`, defaults to `False`):
            Flag to precompute reference model log probabilities for training and evaluation datasets. This is useful if you want to train
            without the reference model and reduce the total GPU memory needed.
        model_init_kwargs: (`Optional[Dict]`, *optional*):
            Dict of Optional kwargs to pass when instantiating the model from a string.
        ref_model_init_kwargs: (`Optional[Dict]`, *optional*):
            Dict of Optional kwargs to pass when instantiating the ref model from a string.
        dataset_num_proc: (`Optional[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Number of processes to use for processing the datasets.
