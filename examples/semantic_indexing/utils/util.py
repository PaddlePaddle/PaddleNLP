    Builds model inputs from a sequence.
        
    A BERT sequence has the following format:

    - single sequence: ``[CLS] X [SEP]``

    Args:
        example(obj:`list(str)`): The list of text to be converted to ids.
        tokenizer(obj:`PretrainedTokenizer`): This tokenizer inherits from :class:`~paddlenlp.transformers.PretrainedTokenizer` 
            which contains most of the methods. Users should refer to the superclass for more information regarding methods.
        max_seq_len(obj:`int`): The maximum total input sequence length after tokenization. 
            Sequences longer than this will be truncated, sequences shorter will be padded.
        is_test(obj:`False`, defaults to `False`): Whether the example contains label or not.

    Returns:
        input_ids(obj:`list[int]`): The list of query token ids.
        token_type_ids(obj: `list[int]`): List of query sequence pair mask.
