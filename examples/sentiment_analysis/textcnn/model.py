class TextCNNModel(nn.Layer):
    """
    This class implements the Text Convolution Neural Network model.
    At a high level, the model starts by embedding the tokens and running them through
    a word embedding. Then, we encode these epresentations with a `CNNEncoder`.
    The CNN has one convolution layer for each ngram filter size. Each convolution operation gives
    out a vector of size num_filter. The number of times a convolution layer will be used
    is `num_tokens - ngram_size + 1`. The corresponding maxpooling layer aggregates all these
    outputs from the convolution layer and outputs the max. 
    Lastly, we take the output of the encoder to create a final representation,
    which is passed through some feed-forward layers to output a logits (`output_layer`).
